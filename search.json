    "text": "K8s For Data Scientists Course\n\n\n\nIf you came here looking for the course, feel free to jump ahead to: K8s For Data Scientists.\nKubernetes, known as K8s, is an open-source system for deploying and managing containerized applications in the cloud. An increasing amount of modern web applications are deployed on K8s. If you are an ML engineer, it is increasingly likely that either the infrastructure you use to train, monitor, or orchestrate your models is deployed on K8s, or downstream applications that consume your models are running on K8s. However, K8s is a complex system that can be intimidating to learn.\nI agree with Chip Huyen that, in theory, Data Scientists shouldn’t need to learn K8s. However, the truth is: Even though you shouldn’t have to, it’s really beneficial if you do! I’ve found that learning the basics of K8s allows me to deploy tools and debug simple issues related to production applications. This is a huge advantage, as it enables me to be more productive and collaborate in a way few others can. Furthermore, Kubernetes provides a standard way of deploying applications with powerful tools to ensure their resilience, making certain tasks significantly easier to accomplish than they would otherwise.\nVicki Boykis seems to agree that the investment in learning this technology is worthwhile1:\nBelow, I outline several reasons why learning K8s is a good idea for machine learning engineers2."

    "section": "Hosted solutions are not always an option",
    "text": "Hosted solutions are not always an option\n\n\n\nA robot concierge helping a scientist\n\n\nThe largest cloud providers offer their own respective flavors of ML infrastructure as hosted solutions3. However, there is often a gap between these offerings and the needs of machine learning teams. For example, I’ve seen the following tools deployed alongside or in place of hosted solutions:\n\nMetaflow\nKubeflow\nArgo\nJupyterHub\nDask\netc.\n\nWhen open source isn’t enough, third-party vendors are happy to install their software on your cloud. However, you often need basic infrastructure skills to enable either of these things. These skills often intersect with Kubernetes.\n\nData Access, Privacy & Security\nEnterprises tend to be very protective of their data. This often means you cannot copy your data to a SaaS solution that is hosted externally. Instead, you want to deploy your tools on infrastructure that already has access to the data. In many cases, K8s will be the best path to accomplish this, especially since many companies are already running K8s.\nFurthermore, you don’t want to deploy tools that inadvertently expose your data. There are many paved paths for using security protocols like IAM4 and RBAC with K8s. Combining this with VPN will allow you to secure data, web apps, and APIs from being exposed. Administering these security protocols and policies is rightfully out-of-scope for ML Engineers. Instead, it is helpful to understand the basics so you can effectively converse with your team."

    "text": "Nobody is coming to save you\n\n\n\nA super hero\n\n\nA typical first experience as a machine learning professional is that you don’t have the necessary tools to get started. This is incredibly frustrating, as making progress without the proper tools can be hard. This experience usually culminates in a conversation like this:\n\nML Eng: I’m excited to join ACME company! You’ve hired me to optimize marketing spending with predictive models. The issue is that we don’t have the basic infrastructure or tools necessary for me to work efficiently.\nManager: I’m confused. Can’t you install the tools you need? Isn’t that what you are for? I was expecting that you would figure it out.\nML Eng: No, I don’t know how to set up and deploy infrastructure. We need a special infrastructure or DevOps person for that.\nManager: It will be hard to ask for more resources if we don’t know the expected return on investment. Can you do the ML project first, demonstrate some value, and then we can invest in infrastructure?\nML Eng: I need some minimum tools to experiment more quickly and develop a proof of concept. Also, I need tools that might help me collaborate better with my team…\n… At this point, the Manager and the ML Eng are stuck debating the chicken and the egg problem. This impasse leads to career dissatisfaction and stagnation.\n\nEarlier in my career, I frantically tried to hire or befriend infrastructure specialists like Michał Jastrzębski and Jeremy Lewi to “save me”. However, I quickly found that this strategy was not sustainable. Instead, these friends showed me how I could fish for myself 95% of the time with basic knowledge.\nBy learning basic infrastructure skills, you can unblock yourself and your team in many cases! Note that K8s are not a panacea for all infrastructure problems, and you must operate within the constraints of your organization and existing software stack.5 There are always cases where K8s could be a poor solution to a problem. However, with its growing popularity, it is increasingly likely that learning this technology will help you."

    "text": "K8s are like an OSS app store\n\n\n\nApp store, abstract\n\n\nMy favorite feature of K8s is they allow you to deploy software consistently, regardless of the type of software (web apps, workflow tools, etc.). Furthermore, K8s are cloud agnostic, so your skills become extremely transferrable across cloud providers and organizations. K8s also offers excellent tools like Helm, Kustomize and more, which makes deploying distributed applications on the cloud very approachable. These tools offer high-level abstractions that allow you to deploy complex applications with one command, with parameters that allow you to change important options. Better yet, the most popular OSS projects can be installed via these tools!6\nAs a reminder, installing your tools in the cloud is important – while you can install software on your laptop, the whole point of many data science tools is to enable better collaboration with your team. To properly evaluate these tools, you will want to install them in an environment that your whole team can observe and interact with."

Traditional education often emphasizes learning the latest ML techniques. However, cutting-edge ML research is very competitive. It’s also an extremely crowded space.\nIn my experience, the bottleneck many teams face is not a lack of knowledge of cutting-edge ML techniques but software engineering skills and partners to help operationalize models. If you take some time to learn how to stand up tools and infrastructure, you will be invaluable to your team.\nMore importantly, being able to deploy and integrate models into services and applications is critical to connecting ML to business problems. Learning K8s will help you do this."

    "text": "Your company likely already runs K8s\n\n\n\nA scientist shaking hands with someone who runs infrastructure\n\n\nJust as Python is the lingua franca of data science, K8s is becoming the lingua franca of cloud infrastructure.7 According to a 2021 Survey by CNCF, 96% of organizations are either using or evaluating Kubernetes. Furthermore, Stack Overflow’s 2022 Developer Survey shows that Docker and Kubernetes are the number one and two most loved and wanted tools, respectively. This is a strong indicator that K8s are here to stay.\nBasic proficiency with K8s will drastically increase your chances of garnering support for your desired tools in many organizations. Proficiency with K8s increases the likelihood that:\n\nYour DevOps counterparts will feel comfortable with the tools you want to deploy\nYou will have a shared language in which to talk to your application administrators\nYou will be more likely to attract people to help you with infra\n\nThese factors make it much more likely that you will get the tools that meet you where you are as opposed to something a software engineer without any data science experience thinks is a good idea (which I’ve seen happen a lot!).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMy friend Michał Jastrzębski, who specializes in ML infrastructure, has shared the following colorful anecdotes with me:\n\nWhen I hear “Data Scientists shouldn’t learn K8s”, I hear “DevOps needs to learn Airflow”.\nDo you really want to wait on a chronically understaffed team to help you stand up basic tools?\nDevOps people don’t want anything to do with maintaining critical infra installed on a single VM.\nCan data scientists meet DevOps halfway and learn a common API that we can both understand?"

    "text": "But isn’t it overkill?\n\n\n\nCutting oranges with a chainsaw\n\n\nFor simple apps that you want to stand up quickly or prototype, K8s is overkill. Instead, I’m advocating knowledge of K8s as useful when working within the environments found in many companies. For example, if you want to deploy production software, hosting your data product on a single VM is often insufficient. Many companies even have infrastructure that may block you from doing this with paved paths that only include Kubernetes.\nEven if you are not deploying any production software, K8s can be invaluable in allowing you to deploy the tools you need. In many cases using K8s can make tasks significantly easier. Enterprises have necessarily invested resources in creating guardrails to control costs and security. Those guardrails are increasingly built around K8s patterns8. Understanding these concepts makes it easier to operate within the confines of your company’s cloud stack."

    "text": "Notes from the book Docker In Action\n;\n\nChapter 1\n\nDocker containers are faster than VMs to start, partly because they do NOT offer any hardware virtualization.\n\nVMs provide hardware abstractions so you can run operating systems.\n\nDocker uses Linux namespaces and cgropus\n\nHamel: I don’t know what this is\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2\n\nGetting help:\n\ndocker help cp\ndocker help run\n\nLinking containers: docker run --link\n\nthis is apparently deprecated per the docs\nOpens a secure tunnel between two containers automatically\nAlso exposes environment variables and other things (see the docs)\n\ndocker cp copy files from a container to local filesystem\nDetach an interactive container:\n\nHold down Control and press P then Q\n\nGet logs docker logs <container name>\n\nHamel: This is like kubectl logs\n\nRun a new command in a running container docker exec\n\ndocker exec <container_name> ps will run the ps command and emit that to stdout\n\nRename a container with docker rename <current_name> <new_name>\ndocker exec run additional processes in an already running container\ndocker create is the same as docker run except that the container is created in a stopped state.\ndocker run --read-only allows you to run a container in a read only state, which you only need to do in special circumstances (you probably never need to use this). You can make exceptions to the read only constraint with the -v flag:\n\n\n\nOverride the entrypoint using the --entrypoint flag (this is discussed in part 2 of the book).\n\n\n\nInjecting environment variables\nWith the --env or -e flags.\nA nice trick to see all the environment variables in a docker container is to use the Unix command env\n\nSetting multiple environment variables: use \\ for multiline like this:\ndocker create \\\n  --env WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=<my database hostname> \\\n  --env WORDPRESS_DB_USER=site_admin \\\n  --env WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=MeowMix42 \\ \nwordpress:4\n\n\nAutomatically restarting containers\nDocker uses an exponential backoff strategy - double the previous time waiting until restarting.\ndocker run -d --restart always ...\nSee these restart policies\n\nno\non-failure[:max-retries]\nalways\nunless-stopped\n\n\n\nRemoving containers vs. images\nContainers are the actual instantiation of an image, just like how an object is an instantion of an instance of a class.\ndocker rm: remove a container docker rmi: remove an image\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nTwo ways to publish an image\n\nBuild locally, push image to registry\nMake a Dockerfile and use DockerHub’s build system. This is preferred and considered to be safer, and DockerHub will mark your image as trusted if you do this because it is the only way to provide transparency to what is in your image.\n\nSearch dockerhub by keyword , sorted descending by stars\n\ndocker search <keyword>\nexample: docker search postgres\n\nUsing Alternative registries\n\ndocker pull quay.io/dockerinaction/ch3_hello_registry:latest\n\n\n\nImages as files\nYou can transport, save and load images as files! (You don’t have to push them to a registry).\n\nYou can then load the image:\ndocker load -i myfile.tar\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Persistent Storage &. Shared State with Volumes\n-v and --volume are aliases\n--volumes-from=\"<container-name>\" Mount all volumes from the given container\n\nDifferent kind of Volumes\n\nBind mount - this is what you always use\nDocker managed volume (2 kinds)\n\nAnonymous\nNamed volume (a special case of Anonymous)\n\n\nUse volumes | Docker Documentation - Named vs. Anonymous volumes: article - Hamel: maybe? You might use named volumes to persist data between containers.\n\n\nTo persist data with named volumes\nNamed volume is a kind of anonymous volume where the mount point is managed by Docker. Example of how you used a named volume:\n\nStart container with a named volume: docker run --name myDatabaseWithVolume -v appdata:/var/lib/mysql  mysql save a table in the mysql database\nStart a new container with the same named volume docker run --name myDatabaseWithVolume2 -v appdata:/var/lib/mysql mysql You should be able to see the same table you created in the last container b/c data has been persisted.\n\n\n\nSee where Docker anonymous volumes store information\nUnlike a bind mount, where you explicitly name the host location, docker will manage the storage location of anonymous volumes. But how do you know where the files are stored on the host?\nYou can use docker inspect command filtered for the Volumes key to find the storage location on the host.\nCreate a container with an anonymous volume. docker run -v /some/location --name cass-shared alpine\ndocker inspect -f \"{{json .Volumes}}\" cass-shared\nThis will output a json blob which will show the mount points.\n\n\nOther things you didn’t know about volumes\n\nwhen you mount a volume, it overrides any files already at that location\n\nYou can mount specific files which avoid this\nif you specify a host directory that doesn’t exist Docker will create it for you\n\nexception: If you are mounting a file instead of a directory and it doesn’t exist on the host, Docker will throw an error\n\n\nyou can mount a volume as read only -v /source:/destination:ro\n\nsee docs (there is this optional third argument for volumes)\n\n\n\n\nThe volumes-from flag\nAllows you to share volumes with another container. When you use this flag, the same volumes are mounted into your container at the same location.\n\nVolumes are copied transitively, so this will automatically mount volumes that are also mounted this way from another container.\nCaveats - You cannot mount a shared volume to a different location within a container. This is a limitation of --volumes-from - If you have a collision in the destination mount point among several volumes-from only one volume will survive, which you can ascertain from docker inpsect - see above for how to use docker inspect - You cannot change the write permission of the volume, you inherit whatever the permission is in the source container.\n\n\nCleaning up volumes\n-v flag\ndocker rm -v will delete any managed volumes referenced by the target container\nHowever, if you delete all containers but forget a -v flag you will be left with an orphaned volume. This is bad b/c it takes up disk space until cleaned up. You have to run complicated cleanup steps to get rid of orphans.\nSolution: There is none, its a good habit to use -v anytime you call docker rm\nHamel: this means that- - Don’t use managed volumes unless you really need it - If you do use them, try to include makefiles that include -v as a part of things\n\n\nAdvanced Volume Stuff\n\nYou can have a volume container p. 72 so that you can reference --volume-from from all your containers.\n\nData-paced volume containers, you can pre-load volume containers with data p. 73\nYou can change the behavior of currently running containers by mounting configuration files and application in volumes. In a way, Hamel\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5 Single Host Networking\n\nTerminology:\n\nprotocols: tcp, http\ninterfaces: IP addresses\nports: you know what this means\n\nCustomary ports:\n\nHTTP: 80\nMySQL: 3306\nMemcached: 11211\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss advanced networking and creating a network using the docker network command. Hamel: I don’t see an immediate use for this.\n\nSpecial container networks:\n\nhost\n\ndocker run --network host allows you to pretend like the host is your local machine, and you can expose any port and that will bind to the host.\n\nnone\n\ndocker run --network none closes all connection to the outside world. This is useful for security.\n\n\n\n\nexposing ports\n-p 8080 This binds port 8080 to a random port on the host! you can find the port that the container is bound to by docker port <image name> example: docker run -p 8080 --name listener alpine docker port listener\nThis will give you output that looks like container --> host (which is reverse the other nomenclature of host:container\n-p 8080:8080 this binds the container’s port to the host’s port 8080\n-p 0.0.0.0:8080:8080/tcp same as above but specifies the interface and the tcp protocol.\nSyntax is -p <host-interface>:<host-port>:<target-port>/<protocol>\n\n\n\nChapter 6 Isolation\n\nLimit resources: Memory, CPU,\n\n-m or --memory\n\nnumber, where unit = b, k, m or g\nmemory limits are not reservations, just caps\n\n--cpu-shares\n\nis a weight you set that is used to calculate % of CPU usage allowed\n% is calculated as weight / (sum of all weights)\nonly enforced when there is contention for a CPU\n\n--cpuset-cpus : limits process to a specific CPU\n\ndocker run -d --cpuset-cpus 0 Restricts to CPU number 0\nCan specify a list or 0,1,2 or a range 0-2\n\n--device\n\nmount your webcam: docker run --device /dev/video0:/dev/video0\n\nShared memory : Hamel this was too advanced for me\n\n\n\nRunning as a user\n\nYou can only inspect the default run-as User by creating or pulling the image\n\nsee p. 113\n\nChange run-as user\n\ndocker run --user nobody\nThe user has to exist in the image when doing this or you will get an error. The user will not be created automatically for you.\nSee available users:\n\ndocker run --rm busybox:latest awk -F: '$0=$1' /etc/passwd\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivileged Containers: TRY NOT TO DO THIS\n\nThis is how you run Docker-in-Docker\nPriviliged containers have root privileges on the host.\n\n--privilged on docker create or docker run\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7 packaging software\nAside: cleaning up your docker environment\ndocker image prune -a and docker container prune\n\nRecovering changes to a stopped container\nI always thought you have to commit changes in order to preserve changes to an image you made in a container. This is not true (although committing changes is a good idea).\nAny changes you make to a container is saved even if the container is exited\nTo recover changes to a container\n\nFind the container (if you didn’t name it with docker run --name it will be named for you), using docker ps -a\nStart the container using docker start -ai <container_name> the -ai flags mean to attach and run interactively\nNow you are in the container you can verify that everything you installed is still there!\n\nNote: if you run your container initially with docker run --rm this automatically removes your container upon exit, so this might not be recommended as your changes are not recoverable if you forget to commit\n\n\n\nSeeing changes to a container from the base image\ndocker diff <container name> will output a long list of of file changes: - A: file added - D: file deleted - C: file changed\n\n\nOther tricks\nYou can override the entry point to the container permanently by using the --entrypoint flag: docker run --entrypoint\n\n\nUnderstanding Images & Layers\n\nfiles are stored in a Union file system, so they are stored in specific layers. The file system you are seeing as an end user are a union of all the layers. Each time a change is made to a union file system, that change is recorded on a new layer on top of all of the others. The “union” of all of those layers, or top-down view, is what the container (and user) sees when accessing the file system.\n\nThis means if you are not careful you can bloat the file system by making a bunch of unnecessary changes to add/delete files.\n\ndocker commit commits the top-layer changes to an image, meaning all the files changes are saved.\n\nSee image size with\ndocker images. Even though you remove a file, the image size will increase! This is because of the Union File System\nSee size of all layers\ndocker history <image name>\nflatten an image This is kind of complicated, you can do this by exporting and importing the filesystem into a base image See pg. 140. BUT there is an experimental feature called docker build --squash -t <image> .You can enable experimental features by following these instructions: dockerd Docker Documentation. For Mac, you can turn on experimental features by setting experimental: true in `settings> Command Line > enable experimental\n\n\n\nChapter 8 Build Automation\n\nuse .dockerignore to prevent certain files from being copied\nYou can set multiple environment variables at once in Dockerfile\nYou can use environment variables in the LABEL command\n\nThe metadata makes it clear that the environment variable substitution works. You can use this form of substitution in the ENV, ADD, COPY, WORKDIR, VOLUME, EXPOSE, and USER instructions.\n\n\nENV APPROOT \"/app\" APP \"mailer.sh\" VERSION \"0.6\"\nLABEL base.name \"Mailer Archetype\" base.version \"${VERSION}\"\n\nview metadata using the command docker inspect <image name>\n\n\nENTRYPOINT something arugment vs. ENTRYPOINT [“something”, “argument”]\nTLDR; use the ugly list approach\nThere are two instruction forms shell form and exec form docker - Dockerfile CMD shell versus exec form - Stack Overflow\nThe ENTRYPOINT instruction has two forms: the shell form and an exec form. The shell form looks like a shell command with whitespace-delimited arguments. The exec form is a string array where the first value is the command to execute and the remaining values are arguments. .\nMost importantly, if the shell form is used for ENTRYPOINT, then all other arguments provided by the CMD instruction or at runtime as extra arguments to docker run will be ignored. This makes the shell form of ENTRYPOINT less flexible.\nOther commands can use the exec form too! You must use the exec form when any of the arguments contain a whitespace:\nFROM dockerinaction/mailer-base:0.6 \nCOPY [\"./log-impl\", \"${APPROOT}\"] \nRUN chmod a+x ${APPROOT}/${APP} && \\ chown example:example /var/log \nUSER example:example \nVOLUME [\"/var/log\"]  # each value in this array will be created as a new volume definition\nCMD [\"/var/log/mailer.log\"]\nNote: you usually don’t want to specify a volume at build time.\n\n\nCMD vs. ENTRYPOINT (You should really try to always use both!)\nCMD is actually an argument list for the ENTRYPOINT.\n\nLogically when you run a container it runs as <default shell program> ENTRYPOINT CMD\nYou can override the ENTRYPOINT with docker run --entrypoint, and you can override commands by just passing commands to docker run : docker run <image name> <command>\n\nFROM ubuntu\n\nENTRYPOINT [ \"ls\" ]\nCMD [\"-lah\"]\nAs you can see using ENTRYPOINT as well as CMD separately provides your downstream users with the most flexibility.\n\n\nCOPY vs ADD\nUse COPY. ADD has additional functionality like ability to download from urls and decompress files, which proved opaque over time and you shouldn’t use it.\n\n\nONBUILD\nThe ONBUILD instruction defines instructions to execute if the resulting image is used as a base for another build. those ONBUILD instructions are executed after the FROM instruction and before the next instruction in a Dockerfile.\nFROM busybox:latest \nWORKDIR /app RUN touch /app/base-evidence \nONBUILD RUN ls -al /app\n\n\nOther Stuff\n\nYou should always validate the presence of required environment variables in a startup shell script like entrypoint.sh\n\n\n\nDocker Digests\nReference the exact SHA of a Container which is the only way to guarantee the image you are referencing has not changed. @ symbol followed by the digest.\nHamel: doesn’t look like a good way to find history of digests, but you can see the current SHA when you use docker pull , you can see the SHA as well if you call docker images --digests\nFROM debian@sha256:d5e87cfcb730...\n\n\n\nChapter 10 (skipped Ch 9)\n\nYou can run your own customized registry. Simplest version can be hosted from a Docker Container!\n\n# start a local registry on port 5000\ndocker run -d --name personal_registry\n \\ -p 5000:5000 --restart=always \n \\ registry:2\n\n# push an image to the registry (using the same image that created the registry for convenience)\ndocker tag registry:2 localhost:5000/distribution:2 \ndocker push localhost:5000/distribution:2\nNote that docker push syntax is actually docker push <registry url>/org/repo\nThis chapter discusses many more things which are skipped: - Centralized registries - Enhancements - Durable blog storage - Integrating through notifications\n\n\nChapter 11 Docker Compose\nDocker compose for fastpages:\nversion: \"3\"\nservices:\n  fastpages: &fastpages\n    working_dir: /data\n    environment:\n        - INPUT_BOOL_SAVE_MARKDOWN=false\n    build:\n      context: ./_action_files\n      dockerfile: ./Dockerfile\n    image: fastpages-dev\n    logging:\n      driver: json-file\n      options:\n        max-size: 50m\n    stdin_open: true\n    tty: true\n    volumes:\n      - .:/data/\n\n  converter:\n    <<: *fastpages\n    command: /fastpages/action_entrypoint.sh\n\n  watcher:\n    <<: *fastpages\n    command: watchmedo shell-command --command /fastpages/action_entrypoint.sh --pattern *.ipynb --recursive --drop\n\n  jekyll:\n    working_dir: /data\n    image: hamelsmu/fastpages-jekyll\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    ports:\n      - \"4000:4000\"\n    volumes:\n      - .:/data/\n    command: >\n     bash -c \"gem install bundler\n     && jekyll serve --trace --strict_front_matter\"\nThe above uses YAML anchors: YAML anchors - Atlassian Documentation\nStart a particular service: docker-compose up <service name> Rebuild a service docker-compose build <service name>\nYou can express dependencies with depends_on which is useful for compose to know which services to restart or start in a specified order.\nSee examples of Docker Compose files on p 243\n\nScaling Up w/Docker Compose\nThat’s right you don’t need docker swarm.

    "text": "EFK Stack\nWe will use the EFK Stack: Elasticsearch, Fluentd, Kibana. This is a common logging stack for K8s.\n\nLog Collector: Fluentd\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe didn’t go deep into FluentD or Fluent-Bit. This may not be that important in the large scheme as in the cloud you have toosl that help with this.\n\n\nFluent Bit is a lightweight version of FluentD. It uses a DaemonSet to run a pod on each node, which uses a HostPath volume mount to access the log files.\nIt reads the log files from the node and sends them to Elasticsearch. It can also parse the logs and add metadata to them. It can also send the logs to other destinations, such as Splunk or AWS CloudWatch.\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: DaemonSet\nmetadata:\n  name: fluent-bit\n  namespace: kiamol-ch13-logging\n  labels:\n    kiamol: ch13\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: fluent-bit\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: fluent-bit\n    spec:\n      serviceAccountName: fluent-bit\n      containers:\n      - name: fluent-bit\n        image: fluent/fluent-bit:1.8.11\n        volumeMounts:\n        - name: fluent-bit-config\n          mountPath: /fluent-bit/etc/\n        - name: varlog\n          mountPath: /var/log\n        - name: varlibdockercontainers\n          mountPath: /var/lib/docker/containers\n          readOnly: true\n      volumes:\n      - name: fluent-bit-config\n        configMap:\n          name: fluent-bit-config\n      - name: varlog\n        hostPath:\n          path: /var/log\n      - name: varlibdockercontainers\n        hostPath:\n          path: /var/lib/docker/containers\nYou should create fluent-bit DaemonSet in a different namespace because you typically want it to run as a shared service used by all the applications running on the cluster. It doesn’t matter that its running in a different namespace because it is reading from each node so it doesn’t matter.\nThere are different pieces you can configure with FluentD\n\nWe’re currently running a simple configuration with three stages:\n\nthe input stage reads log files\nthe parser stage deconstructs the JSON log entries,\nand the output stage writes each log as a separate line to the standard output stream in the Fluent Bit container.\n\nBelow is part of a Fluent Bit configuration file:\nkind: ConfigMap\n...\n[INPUT]\n   Name              tail         # Reads from the end of a file\n   Tag               kube.*       # Uses a prefix for the tag\n   Path              /var/log/containers/timecheck*.log\n   Parser            docker       # Parses the JSON container logs\n   Refresh_Interval  10        # Sets the frequency to check the file list\n\n[OUTPUT]\n   Name            stdout         # Writes to standard out\n   Format          json_lines     # Formats each log as a line\n   Match           kube.*         # Writes logs with a kube tag prefix\nFluent Bit uses tags to identify the source of a log entry. The tag is added at the input stage and can be used to route logs to other stages. In this configuration, the log file name is used as the tag, prefixed with kube. The match rule routes all the kube tagged entries to the output stage so every log is printed out, but the input stage reads only the timecheck log files, so those are the only log entries you see.\nWhen you apply the configuration (revisit this chapter to see all the details), you can see the logs in the Fluent Bit container:\nkubectl logs  -l app=fluent-bit -n kiamol-ch13-logging --tail 2\nThis will show you logs from all namespaces, as fluentd is reading the logs from all nodes.\n\nRouting Output\nIf you look at the file fluentbit/update/fluentbit-config-match.yaml you will see a boilerplate config that is generic that will work with any cluster. (You just have to change the namespace and labels). You end up with tag that is kube.<namespace_name>.<container_name>.<pod_name>.<docker_id>- and then the log file name. Based on this, you can route output like so:\n```(.yml file=“fluentbit/update/fluentbit-config-match-multiple.yaml”) [OUTPUT] Name stdout # The standard out plugin will Format json_lines # print only log entries where Match kube.kiamol-ch13-test.* # the namespace is test.\n[OUTPUT] Name counter # The counter prints a count of Match kube.kiamol-ch13-dev.* # logs from the dev namespace.\n\nThis shows you that you can have different kinds of logs for different namespaces, for example the `dev` namespace is counting the lines of logs.  The counter is a plugin that is built into FluentD.\n\n### Elasticsearch\n\nElasticsearch is a database, where each datum can have different fields, there is no fixed schema.  You access it via a REST API.  Kibana is a web interface for Elasticsearch. Fluent Bit has an Elasticsearch output plugin that creates a document for each log entry using the Elasticsearch REST API. The plugin needs to be configured with the domain name of the Elasticsearch server, and you can optionally specify the index where documents should be created.  Note that if there are logs that don't match an output rule, they will be discarded:\n\n```{.yml filename=\"fluentbit-config-elasticsearch.yaml\"}\n[OUTPUT]\n   Name       es                            # Logs from the test namespace\n   Match      kube.kiamol-ch13-test.*       # are routed to Elasticsearch\n   Host       elasticsearch                 # and created as documents in \n   Index      test                          # the \"test\" index.\n\n[OUTPUT]\n   Name       es                            # System logs are created in\n   Match      kube.kube-system.*            # the \"sys\" index in the same\n   Host       elasticsearch                 # Elasticsearch server.\n   Index      sys\nWe deploy Elasticsearch and Kibana and get the endpoint of Kibana.\nI skipped the rest of this b/c I’m hoping cloud services provide a good logging stack for me. Also, you will likely want to use plugins for FluentD."

For example, a Pod might fetch a batch of up to N items from the work queue. - each Pod is independently capable of determining whether or not all its peers are done, and thus that the entire Job is done. - when any Pod from the Job terminates with success, no new Pods are created. - once at least one Pod has terminated with success and all Pods are terminated, then the Job is completed with success. - once any Pod has exited with success, no other Pod should still be doing any work for this task or writing any output.

In order to prevent one Pod from monopolizing all available resources, you should set resource limits for Pods. You should set both a memory limit and a CPU limit. If a Pod is using more than its resource limit, it is restarted (new container). If it continues to fail, will go into a CrashLoopBackoff just like with liveness probes.\nYou can specify resource limits in the spec.containers[].resources.limits section of a Pod configuration. The following example sets a memory limit of 50 MiB for a container:\n\n\nvmemory-allocator-with-limit.yaml\n\nspec:                       # The Pod spec in the Deployment\n containers:\n   - image: kiamol/ch12-memory-allocator\n     resources:\n       limits:             # Resource limits constrain the compute power\n         memory: 50Mi      # for the container; this limits RAM to 50 MB.\n\nWhen you create this Pod, the container is automatically assigned a memory limit of 256 MiB.

If there’s a quota in place, then every Pod spec needs to include a resource section so Kubernetes can compare what the spec needs to what’s currently available in the namespace.\n\n\nNow, if a pod specifies a limit that is greater than the namespace quota, it will not be created.

Network policies are like firewall rules that allow or deny traffic to pods. Network policies are applied to pods using labels. This can be used to block incoming and outgoing traffic.\nOutgoing traffic is referred to as egress and incoming traffic is referred to as ingress, which should not be confused with the ingress resource.\nFor example, the below network policy will only allow traffic to pods labeled app: apod-api from pods labeled app: apod-web:\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: NetworkPolicy\nmetadata:\n name: apod-api\nspec:\n podSelector:             # This is the Pod where the rule applies.\n   matchLabels:\n     app: apod-api       \n ingress:                 # Rules default to deny, so this rule\n - from:                  # denies all ingress except where the \n   - podSelector:         # source of the traffic is a Pod with \n       matchLabels:       # the apod-web label.\n         app: apod-web\n   ports:                 # This restriction is by port.\n   - port: api            # The port is named in the API Pod spec.\nHowever this doesn’t do anything! Just like you need an ingress controller, you need something in your cluster’s networking system to enforce this. This involves installing various plugins, which your DevOps team should be doing. Furthermore, different cloud platforms make this easier or harder."

    "text": "Terminology:\n\nsubject: a user, system account or group.\nRole: a defined set of permissions that you will apply to subject(s).\nRoleBinding: config where you assign roles to subject(s).\n\nRBAC grants permissoins to perform actions on resources. You set a permissions in a role, and apply the role to one or more subject.\n\nGroup, Versions, Kinds and Resources\nA resource is described by the triple (group, version, kind) (GVK for short)\nSee this page\nIt is important to understand groups, versions, kinds, and resources for RBAC.\n\nKinds: each (group, version) contains one or more api types called Kinds. These are guaranteed to be compatible across versions\nResource: A use of Kind in the API. There is often a one-to-one mapping between Kinds and Resources. For instance, the pods resource corresponds to the Pod Kind. You can see the correspondence with the command kl api-resources --sort-by name.\n\nHowever the same Kind may be returned by multiple resources. For example, the Pod Kind is returned by the pods and pods/log resources Notice that resources are always lowercase, and by convention are the lowercase form of the Kind.\n\napiGroup: A collection of related functionality. Each group has one or more versions. This allows us to change how an API works over time. The api groups are referenced here.\n\nTo lookup the apiGroup for a resource, you can use the command kl api-resources --sort-by name, and ignoring the version name. For example, the pods resource is part of the core apiGroup which is the empty string in the spec (see below). You can also look at the reference docs, for example PriorityClass is part of the scheduling.k8s.io apiGroup, which is indicated here.\n\n\nExample of how to lookup the apiGroup and resource name for kind: PriorityClass:\n\n```bash\n$  kl api-resources --sort-by name\n\nNAME                              SHORTNAMES   APIVERSION                             NAMESPACED   KIND\n...\npriorityclasses                   pc           scheduling.k8s.io/v1                   false        PriorityClass\nThis tells us that the PriorityClass Kind is part of the scheduling.k8s.io apiGroup, and the resource name is priorityclasses.\n\n\nRole vs ClusterRole\nSome resources are namespaces, some are cluster wide.\n\nRole and RoleBinding work on namepsaced objects.\nClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding work on the whole cluster\n\nThere are lots of built in ClusterRoles which you can see with:\nkl get clusterrole"

    "section": "Defining Roles",
    "text": "Defining Roles\nYou can define your own Role and ClusterRole objects. In addition to apiGroups andresources which we discussed above, you will also need to know about verbs.\nYou can see all the api request verbs here, which are: get, list, create, update, patch, watch, delete, and deletecollection.\nThe apiGroups referenced here is helpful to see the correspondence between the resource and the apiGroup. Below is an example Role and ClusterRole (which are not related):\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 # this is the Group/Version used in the Binding\nkind: Role\nmetadata:\n  namespace: default\n  name: pod-reader\nrules:\n- apiGroups: [\"\"] # \"\" indicates the core API group\n  resources: [\"pods\"] #pods are part of the Core: \n  verbs: [\"get\", \"watch\", \"list\"]\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: ClusterRole\nmetadata:\n  # \"namespace\" omitted since ClusterRoles are not namespaced\n  name: secret-reader\nrules:\n- apiGroups: [\"\"] # secrets are part of Core https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.26/#secret-v1-core\n  resources: [\"secrets\"] # The name of the resource for accessing Secret objects is \"secrets\"\n  verbs: [\"get\", \"watch\", \"list\"]\n\nRoleBinding\nBelow is an example of a RoleBinding that grants the pod-reader role to the user jane in the namespace default. As a reminder, a RoleBinding assigns subjects to a Role, and a Role defines permissions. Thats why the below example doesn’t define any permissions. That is the associated Role’s job.\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\n# This role binding allows \"jane\" to read pods in the \"default\" namespace.\n# You need to already have a Role named \"pod-reader\" in that namespace.\nkind: RoleBinding\nmetadata:\n  name: read-pods\n  namespace: default\nsubjects:\n# You can specify more than one \"subject\"\n- kind: User\n  name: jane # \"name\" is case sensitive\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\nroleRef:\n  # \"roleRef\" specifies the binding to a Role / ClusterRole\n  kind: Role #this must be Role or ClusterRole\n  name: pod-reader # this must match the name of the Role or ClusterRole you wish to bind to\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\nA RoleBinding can also reference a ClusterRole to grant the permissions defined in that ClusterRole to resources inside the RoleBinding’s namespace. This kind of reference lets you define a set of common roles across your cluster, then reuse them within multiple namespaces which we saw above with RoleBinding to a ClusterRole.\n\nRoleBindings w/ existing ClusterRoles\nAn easy path is to use an existing built in ClusterRole and assign it to a subject. For example, we can assign the view role to a specific user:\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: RoleBinding\nmetadata:\n name: reader-view\n namespace: default                    # The scope of the binding\nsubjects:\n- kind: User\n  name: reader@kiamol.net               # The subject is the new user\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io   # The version of the K8s API used to specify the subject\nroleRef:\n kind: ClusterRole\n name: view                      # Gives them the view role from the built-in ClusterRole\n apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io   # The version of the K8s API used to specify the roleRef\nBy RoleBinding to an existing ClusterRole, you dont have to bother with creating a Role! Its a nice shortcut when you can get away with it.\nSeveral important notes:\n\nWe have to assign the RoleBinding to a namespace, because RoleBinding is scoped to a namespace, even though we are referencing an existing ClusterRole. Yes, you can create a RoleBinding to a ClusterRole you aren’t limited to only a Role!\n\nThe apiGroup is the version of the K8s api you are using to specify that object. For practical purposes, just accept the value rbac.authorization.k8s.io as boilerplate. Also if you leave this out, defaults values will probably be just fine.\n\nFrom the docs: APIGroup holds the API group of the referenced subject. Defaults to “” for ServiceAccount subjects. Defaults to “rbac.authorization.k8s.io” for User and Group subjects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must have a RoleBinding\n\n\n\nRoles are additive or grant-only (you can’t deny permissions). This means hat everything starts with no permissions and you must add them. What this also means that if you create a Role (in this case the reader-view) but no RoleBinding then your subject will have no permissions to do anything!\n\n\nAnother example of a RoleBinding to a ClusterRole:\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\n# This role binding allows \"dave\" to read secrets in the \"development\" namespace.\n# You need to already have a ClusterRole named \"secret-reader\".\nkind: RoleBinding\nmetadata:\n  name: read-secrets\n  #\n  # The namespace of the RoleBinding determines where the permissions are granted.\n  # This only grants permissions within the \"development\" namespace.\n  namespace: development\nsubjects:\n- kind: User\n  name: dave # Name is case sensitive\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\nroleRef:\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: secret-reader\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n\n\n\nClusterRoleBinding\nTo grant permissions across a whole cluster, you can use a ClusterRoleBinding. The following ClusterRoleBinding allows any user in the group “manager” to read secrets in any namespace.\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\n# This cluster role binding allows anyone in the \"manager\" group to read secrets in any namespace.\nkind: ClusterRoleBinding\nmetadata:\n  name: read-secrets-global\nsubjects:\n- kind: Group\n  name: manager # Name is case sensitive\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\nroleRef:\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: secret-reader\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAfter you create a binding, you cannot change the Role or ClusterRole that it refers to. If you try to change a binding’s roleRef, you get a validation error. If you do want to change the roleRef for a binding, you need to remove the binding object and create a replacement.\n\n\n\n\nA More complex example\nBelow is an example of a custom Role with a RoleBinding:\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Role\nmetadata:\n name: system-pod-reader\n namespace: kube-system        # Scoped to the system namespace\nrules:\n- apiGroups: [\"\"]               # The API group of the object spec\n resources: [\"pods\"]           # Pods are in the core group, which\n verbs: [\"get\", \"list\"]        # is identified with an empty string.\n---\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: RoleBinding\nmetadata:\n name: kube-explorer-system\n namespace: kube-system         # Needs to match the role\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: kube-explorer            # The subject can be in a\n  namespace: default             # different namespace.\nroleRef:\n apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n kind: Role\n name: system-pod-reader"

It is just useful to know what they are, since some of the terms/concepts can show up in error messages.\nWebhooks provide a way for you to validate if a K8s cluster should run an object. Some of these are built in – like the ResourceQuota, which stops workloads from running if they exceed quotas. Webhooks that block workloads are called ValidatingAdmissionWebhook.\nThere is also the MutatingAdmissionWebhook which can modify objects before they are created. This is useful for things like injecting sidecars into pods or adding labels to objects. It’s hard to tell if a resource has been mutated as there is no indication when you run kubectl describe. This is one very undesirable feature of webhooks, as they are hard to debug and are not visible. There is something called an Open Policy Agent (OPA) that can be used to mitigate these issues. Example of confusion caused by a Mutating webhook:\nWebhooks can be expressed in arbitrary code like python or javascript. These can run inside or outside the cluster but must be served on HTTPS.\nYou have to document the rules of webhooks outside the cluster, as their rules are not discoverable by kubectl.\nWebhooks are used to enforce rules like:"

    "text": "Load balancers are an easy way to expose apps, however Ingress is yet a different way that is more suited to HTTP requests. Here are some key differences:\n\nLoad Balancers can accept any kind of traffic (TCP, UDP, etc).\nCloud Kubernetes platforms like AKS and EKS are highly available multinode clusters. Deploying a Kubernetes LoadBalancer Service creates an actual load balancer in your cloud, which spans all the nodes in your cluster—the cloud load balancer sends incoming traffic to one of the nodes and then Kubernetes routes it to a Pod. You’ll get a different IP address for each LoadBalancer Service, and it will be a public address, accessible from the internet. What this means is that a LoadBalancer will spin up additional resources on your cloud provider. This doesn’t have to be the case with Ingress.\nCloud providers often charge based on “load balancing rules”, which roughly translates into how many load balancing external IP addresses are assigned. By using an ingress to combine several services into one, rather than each being exposed with it’s own IP, you can likely save money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocker Desktop\n\n\n\nDocker Desktop’s local Kubernetes runs on a single machine and integrates with the network stack so LoadBalancer Services are available at the localhost address."

    "text": "Ingress\nFor HTTPS, Ingress is the preferred way to expose your apps. You can have multiple services exposed on one host, whereas you cannot do that with a LoadBalancer. Ingress allows you to route requests based on the URL path. Ingress allows you to make changes to your services without changing the address to the end user (ex: if you want different url paths to now go to different services).\n\nIngress Controller\nAn Ingress controller is responsible for fulfilling the Ingress, usually with a load balancer.\nThe Ingress Resource doesn’t do anything by itself; you need an ingress controller which does the work of routing requests. The ingress controller often contains a reverse proxy like Nginx. When you set this up on cloud providers they may offer something a bitt different. Reverse proxies intercept requests and route them to where they need to go. These reverse proxies can also do other things like caching, load balancing, URL rewrites, and so on. There are lots of flavors of Ingress Resources (like Nginx, Traefik, etc).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud providers give you an Ingress controller\n\n\n\nIf you’re using a managed cluster with one of the major cloud providers, an ingress controller is already in place. In Google Kubernetes Engine, the ingress controller is GLBC (GCE L7 Load Balancer), in AWS the Ingress functionality is provided by the AWS Load Balancer Controller, while Azure provides AGIC (Application Gateway Ingress Controller).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a reverse proxy?\n\n\n\nReverse proxies intercept incoming web requests and can take different actions, such as rewriting the URL (changing the path), or routing different paths to different places. They can also provide security by blocking or ignoring certain requests and caching results. For these reasons, reverse proxies are a must-have for any production web application.\nReverse proxies are different than proxy servers. Proxy servers forward traffic from a requestor/client – “outbound traffic”. Reverse proxies intercept client requests and forward them to the server – “inbound traffic”. For example, proxy servers can hide the identity of the client. Reverse proxies can hide the identity of the server.\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not go with your cloud provider’s hosted K8s solution with a provided ingress controller, an experienced devops person will setup the ingress for you. Your DevOps team should deploy an Ingress controller for you. Your DevOps team should provide you with a template for the Ingress Resource, which may reference the Ingress controller. The important part is that you are comfortable enough to know what it is doing to modify an Ingress Resource template. You should not have to create an Ingress Resource from scratch.\nIn the below example, our Ingress controller is a load balancer that is also running Nginx. Below is the Service and the Deployment parts of the Ingress Controller to give you an idea that the controller itself is a LoadBalancer. The Deployment is a Deployment of the Nginx reverse proxy. The Service is a LoadBalancer Service that exposes the Nginx reverse proxy. You probably won’t and should not have to ever deal this.\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: ingress-nginx-controller\n  namespace: kiamol-ingress-nginx\nspec:\n  type: LoadBalancer\n  ports:\n    - name: http\n      port: 80\n      targetPort: http\n    - name: https\n      port: 443\n      targetPort: https\n  selector:\n    app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx\n    app.kubernetes.io/instance: ingress-nginx\n    app.kubernetes.io/component: controller\n---\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: ingress-nginx-controller\n  namespace: kiamol-ingress-nginx\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx\n      app.kubernetes.io/instance: ingress-nginx\n      app.kubernetes.io/component: controller\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app.kubernetes.io/name: ingress-nginx\n        app.kubernetes.io/instance: ingress-nginx\n        app.kubernetes.io/component: controller\n    spec:\n      containers:\n        - name: controller\n          image: k8s.gcr.io/ingress-nginx/controller:v1.1.1@sha256:0bc88eb15f9e7f84e8e56c14fa5735aaa488b840983f87bd79b1054190e660de\n          args:\n            - /nginx-ingress-controller\n            - --publish-service=kiamol-ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx-controller\n            - --election-id=ingress-controller-leader\n            - --ingress-class=nginx\n            - --configmap=kiamol-ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx-controller\n          securityContext:\n            runAsUser: 101\n            allowPrivilegeEscalation: true\n          env:\n            - name: POD_NAME\n              valueFrom:\n                fieldRef:\n                  fieldPath: metadata.name\n            - name: POD_NAMESPACE\n              valueFrom:\n                fieldRef:\n                  fieldPath: metadata.namespace\n          ports:\n            - name: http\n              containerPort: 80\n              protocol: TCP\n            - name: https\n              containerPort: 443\n              protocol: TCP\n      serviceAccountName: ingress-nginx\n---\n\n\nIngress Resource\nThis is an example of an Ingress Resource (the kind of file you may edit). Note that the path is one type of common configuration, and controller-specific options are specified via annotations (in the second example).\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: timeserver-ingress\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: timeserver-internal\n            port:\n              number: 80\n      - path: /robohash\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: robohash-internal\n            port:\n              number: 80\nAnother example of an ingress:\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: hello-kiamol\n  annotations: # this was added b/c of this https://github.com/sixeyed/kiamol/issues/32\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: \"nginx\" \n  labels:\n    kiamol: ch15\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: hello-kiamol\n            port:\n              number: 80\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIngress Annotations\n\n\n\nAn ingress template should be provided to you by a DevOps engineer. You should not need to create one from scratch. This should vary from company to company. The annotations are special parameters passed along to the controller since the Ingress Resource spec is very minimal in the options it can take and because Ingress controllers have different capabilities. The annotations are controller-specific.\n\n\nYou can also have several hosts in the same ingress:\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: timeserver-ingress\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - host: timeserver.example.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: timeserver-internal\n            port:\n              number: 80\n  - host: robohash.example.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: robohash-internal\n            port:\n              number: 80\nBy using host-based routing, you can host several services all with the same external IP address. The ingress inspects the Host header in the HTTP request, and routes traffic accordingly. This contrast with Services of type LoadBalancer which each get their own IP address assigned and perform no packet inspection or routing.\nIt is worth reading the docs on Path types and what happens when there are multiple matches.\n\n\nDefault Backend\nYou can direct anything that doesn’t match any of the rules to a generic 404 page by specifying a default backend:\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: kiada\nspec:\n  defaultBackend:\n    service:\n      name: fun404\n      port:\n        name: http\n  rules:\n  ...\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: fun404\n  labels:\n    app: fun404\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: server\n    image: luksa/static-http-server\n    args:\n    - --listen-port=8080\n    - --response-code=404\n    - --text=This isn't the URL you're looking for.\n    ports:\n    - name: http\n      containerPort: 8080\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: fun404\n  labels:\n    app: fun404\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: fun404\n  ports:\n  - name: http\n    port: 80\n    targetPort: http"

This is very common when the cluster is running in the cloud. If the address isn’t displayed after several minutes, it means that no ingress controller has processed the Ingress object. Check if the controller is running. Since a cluster can run multiple ingress controllers, it’s possible that they’ll all ignore your Ingress object if you don’t specify which of them should process it.

    "text": "TLS / HTTPS Encryption\nTLS: Transport Layer Security, formerly known as SSL or Secure Sockets Layer.\n\nHow Does HTTPS Work?\nHTTPS uses the HTTP protocol with TLS and SSL encryption added on top. The initial handshake uses asymmetric encryption and then further communication happens with symmetric encryption. This is how it works:\n\nA website references an SSL Certificate that contains a public key. The SSL Certificate is provided by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).\n\nYou can check the authenticity of the certificate by using a separate public key from the CA to decrypt the CA’s signature (the CA has their own private key to encrypt its digital signature). Your browser has a list of trusted CAs. Your browser often gets these from other trusted sources like your operating system.\n\nChrome Root CA Policy, 2022-09-01 “When making HTTPS connections, Chrome refers to a list of root certificates from CAs that have demonstrated why continued trust in them is justified. This list is known as a “Root Store.” CA certificates included in the Chrome Root Store are selected on the basis of publicly available and verified information, such as that within the Common CA Database (CCADB), and ongoing reviews by the Chrome Root Program. CCADB is a datastore run by Mozilla and used by various operating systems, browser vendors, and CA owners to share and disclose information regarding the ownership, historical operation, and audit history of CAs and corresponding certificates and key material. Historically, Chrome has integrated with the Root Store provided by the platform on which it is running. In Chrome 105, Chrome began a platform-by-platform transition from relying on the host operating system’s Root Store to its own on Windows, macOS, ChromeOS, Linux, and Android. This change makes Chrome more secure and promotes consistent user and developer experiences across platforms. Apple policies prevent the Chrome Root Store and corresponding Chrome Certificate Verifier from being used on Chrome for iOS.”\n\nThese CAs come from trustworthy sources like Cloudflare, Google, etc.\nLet’s Encrypt, a popular CA checks that the certificate request comes from a person who actually controls the domain. They do this by sending the client a unique token and then Lets Encrypt makes a web or DNS request to retrieve a key derived from that token.\n\nAfter the initial verification and handshake, the client and server use a symmetric encryption key to communicate securely. The client and server both have the same symmetric key. This is the key that is used to encrypt and decrypt the data.\n\nSee this article and also this one\n\n\nTLS Termination and HTTPS\nSome Ingress controllers like Trafefik have integrations with Let’s Encrypt to automate the entire process of getting a certificate and renewing it. They also handle TLS termination, which is decrypting the traffic and forwarding it on the appropriate place. Ingress is a nice place to handle TLS because it allows you to have a standardized way of handling TLS for all your services.\nThese ingress controllers allow you to specify a secret that contains the TLS certificate and private key, and they will handle the rest. All you need to do is add a TLS section to your Ingress spec and state the name of the Secret to use:\nFirst you need to create a secret (ideally you would never create a certificate like this, but this is just for demo purposes)\n# create a Secret:\n$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout example.key -out example.crt \\\n  -sha256 -days 7300 -nodes \\\n  -subj '/CN=*.example.com' \\\n  -addext 'subjectAltName = DNS:*.example.com' \n \n$ kubectl create secret tls tls-example-com --cert=example.crt --key=example.key\nsecret/tls-example-com created\nThen reference the secret from the Ingress spec:\non: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: kiada\nspec:\n  tls:\n  - secretName: tls-example-com\n    hosts:\n    - \"*.example.com\" # The hosts specified in tls.hosts must match the names used in the certificate in the secret.\n  rules:\n  ..."

    "text": "[[Ambassador]]\nThese are [[Sidecar]] containers that act as proxys. You can do this for reliability or security. Proxy containers can do load balancing, retries, or encrypt items. [[service mesh]] uses patterns like this.\nFor example you may want to restrict what web requests or URLs your app is allowed to talk to. With an ambassador sidecar, you can block all traffic besides the allowed one. Here is an example:\n      containers:\n        - name: web\n          image: kiamol/ch03-numbers-web \n          env:\n          - name: http_proxy\n            value: http://localhost:1080\n          - name: RngApi__Url\n            value: http://localhost/api\n        - name: proxy                         # this is a basic proxy\n          image: kiamol/ch07-simple-proxy          \n          env:\n          - name: Proxy__Port                 #Routes network requets given \n            value: \"1080\"                     # the below mapping\n          - name: Proxy__Request__UriMap__Source\n            value: http://localhost/api\n          - name: Proxy__Request__UriMap__Target\n            value: http://numbers-api/sixeyed/kiamol/master/ch03/numbers/rng\nIn the above example, anything that is not in the mapping is blocked. Now the web app is restricted to a single address for outgoing requests, which are logged by the proxy.\nthe app container uses localhost addresses for any services it consumes, and it’s configured to route all network calls through the proxy container. The proxy is a custom app that logs network calls, maps localhost addresses to real addresses, and blocks any addresses that are not listed in the map. All that becomes functionality in the Pod, but it’s transparent to the application container.\nYou can also use Ambassador’s for database connections, to query read-only copies when there are no db updates/writes:"

Doing so will limit you, as you want to be able to scale/upgrade etc these different components independently.\nThere are two patterns:\n\n[[Sidecar]] runs alongside; pod isn’t considered ready until all the containers are ready. This is what is shown above.\n[Init containers] you can have multiple init containers, they run in sequence, in order they are specified. Each must complete sucessfully before next one starts, and all must complete sucessfully before the Pod containers start (if mulitple they are sidecars)\n\nInit containers are often used to generate data for container Pods (which is written to a shared mounted directory as previously shown). An example is an init container w/ the git command line installed that clones a repo to a shared file system.

For example, the following service:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: numbers-api\nspec:\n  ports:\n    - port: 80\n  selector:\n    app: numbers-api\n  type: ClusterIP # this isn't necessary, it's the default\nCan be referenced with just http://numbers-api – that is how it’s referenced in the application.\nIf the pod trying to reach that service is in a different namespace, you have to use the fully qualified name <service-name>.<namespace>, which would be http://numbers-api.default in this case.\n\nTesting DNS\nThe best way to test internal DNS problems is to use nslookup in a pod. You can deploy a pod specifically for network testing from the official k8s docs:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: dnsutils\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: dnsutils\n    image: registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/jessie-dnsutils:1.3\n    command:\n      - sleep\n      - \"infinity\"\n    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent\n  restartPolicy: Always\nYou can also reference the yaml like this kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/admin/dns/dnsutils.yaml\nLet’s say I’ve deployed a service called numbers-api in the default namespace:\n$ kl get svc\nNAME          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE\nnumbers-api   ClusterIP   10.98.154.232    <none>        80/TCP           13m\nYou can now test it with nslookup:\n# use nslookup <service-name> if the pod dnsutils ins int he same namespace as the service\nkubectl exec -i -t dnsutils -- nslookup numbers-api\n\n# or if your pod is in a different namespace than the service use <service-name>.<namespace>\nkubectl exec -i -t dnsutils -- nslookup numbers-api.default\nIf you are experiencing further issues, follow these debugging instructions\n\n\nLabels\nIf you have overlapping labels for a particular deployment, the service will route to all deployments that match that label. If you want to control for this, add additional unique labels. Just having one label like “myapp” can be dangerous for this reason.\nServices deal with networking. These use labels, too via a selector.\n\n\n\nRouting internal traffic ClusterIP\nClusterIP: default service that is internal DNS. type: ClusterIP\nForward port 8080 on your local computer to port 80 in container: kubectl port-forward deploy/numbers-web 8080:80\n\n\nRouting external traffic: LoadBalancer\ntype: LoadBalancer Uses labels too\n\n\nRouting Traffic Outside K8s ExternalNameService\ntype: ExternalName\nYou have to watch out when making HTTP requests through ENS, b/c the header wil still contain the original hostname, which will probably get rejected. It’s fine for things like TCP etc for databases.\n\n\nNamespaces\nThis is relevant to networking b/c resources outside the default namespace will have a different network address\nkubectl get svc -n default kubectl get svc -n kube-system\nFor example, the internal kube-dns service:\n kl get svc -n kube-system                                                                                                                                                                            (master)kiamol\nNAME       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                  AGE\nkube-dns   ClusterIP   10.96.0.10   <none>        53/UDP,53/TCP,9153/TCP   9d\nCan be accessed like this kl exec deploy/sleep-1 -- sh - c'nslookup kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local"

K8s will not merge directories for you!\nIf you change the config map, it will refresh the files in the directory.

ReplicaSets]] or [[DaemonSets]]\nWhen you deploy a StatefulSet, it creates Pods with predictable names, which can be individually accessed over DNS, and starts them in order; the first Pod needs to be up and running before the second Pod is created.\nIf you are trying to model database on K8s, you might use StatefulSet. However, don’t put DBs on K8s - use a managed service for that instead. StatefulSet just gives you determinstic Pod names and networking, you have to take care of synching your apps yourself. That would be outside the scope of what DS should do IMO.\nHere is kind: StatefulSet\n % cat todo-list/db/todo-db.yaml                                                                                                      \napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: StatefulSet\nmetadata:\n  name: todo-db\n  labels:\n    kiamol: ch08\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: todo-db\n  serviceName: todo-db\n  replicas: 2\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: todo-db\nWhen you get pods, they will be incremented from 0, this allows you network/communicate with them deterministically.\n% kl get po                                                                                                                         \nNAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\ntodo-db-0   1/1     Running   0          23s\ntodo-db-1   1/1     Running   0          21s\nStatefulSet is a controller, so if you delete a pod the StatefulSet will recreate it.\n\nInitContainers\nYou can bootstrap pods with initcontainers and stateful sets.

This is just an idea, you probably should never do this yourself.\n\n\nNetworking In StatefulSets\nYou need to have a special configuration “headless Service” to setup newtworking for StatefulSets, by setting ClusterIP: None\n%cat todo-list/db/todo-db-service.yaml                                                                                              \napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: todo-db\n  labels:\n    kiamol: ch08\nspec:\n  ports:                  # 5432 is the port Postgres uses\n    - port: 5432\n      targetPort: 5432 \n      name: postgres\n  selector:\n    app: todo-db\n  clusterIP: None             # Note how this is None\nThe pod will be reachable at pod-name.service-name.cluster-domain-suffix. for example:\ntodo-db-0.todo-db.default.svc.cluster.local\nSee: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#stable-network-id\n\nA StatefulSet can use a Headless Service to control the domain of its Pods. The domain managed by this Service takes the form: \\((service name).\\)(namespace).svc.cluster.local, where “cluster.local” is the cluster domain. As each Pod is created, it gets a matching DNS subdomain, taking the form: \\((podname).\\)(governing service domain), where the governing service is defined by the serviceName field on the StatefulSet.\n\nThis is also related to the serviceName field on the StatefulSet\nYou can lookup the cluster-domain-suffix like this :\nkl exec deploy/sleep -- sh -c 'nslookup todo-db'`\nThe headless service still does load balancing, but lets you access the Pod\n\n\nStorage\nFor DBs you want each pod to have its own persistent disk, there is a shortcut: using volumeClaimTemplates which makes sure each Pod in the stateful set always gets its own persistent volume.\n% cat sleep/sleep-with-pvc.yaml                                             \n...\nkind: StatefulSet\n  template:\n    ...\n  volumeClaimTemplates:\n  - metadata:\n      name: data\n      labels:\n        kiamol: ch08\n    spec:\n      accessModes:\n       - ReadWriteOnce\n      resources:\n        requests:\n          storage: 5Mi\nEach pod will get a PVC created dynamically, which will create a Persistent Volume using the default storage class (or the requested storage class if included in the spec).\nThe link b/w each pod and its PVC is maintained when pods are replaced. For example:\n# create a file\nkl exec sleep-with-pvc-0 -- sh -c 'echo pod 0 > /data/pod.txt'\n\n#delete the pod\nkl delete po sleep-with-pvc-0\n\n# this will show the right contents\nkl exec sleep-with-pvc-0 -- cat /data/pod.txt"

DaemonSets are yet another kind of controller for Pods beyond [[Deployments]]\nIf you switch from a Deployment to a DaemonSet you should delete the Deployment first. You can’t automatically change from one kind of controller to another.\nA DaemonSet runs a control loop that will watch for any new nodes and start a pod on that node.\n\nUse cases for DaemonSets:\n\nWant to run a pod on every node\nyou have only a subset of nodes that can receive traffic from the internet -> use labels to achieve this.\n\n\n\nLabeling A Node For DaemonSets\nThis allows you to select which nodes the Daemonset runs on:\n% cat pi/proxy/daemonset/nginx-ds-nodeSelector.yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: DaemonSet\nmetadata:\n  name: pi-proxy\n  labels:\n    kiamol: ch06\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: pi-proxy\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: pi-proxy\n    spec:\n...\n      nodeSelector:\n        kiamol: ch06\nTo use thie above yaml, you have to label your node like this:\nkl label node $(kl get nodes...) kiamol=ch06 --overwrite\n\n\nCascade Delete\nTLDR; you probably don’t need this\nYou can set cascade=False to delete a controller without deleting its managed objects. This is how you can change a controller but still keep pods alive.\nkl delete ds pi-proxy --cascade=orphan  # deletes the daemonset pi-proxy\nControllers use a label selector to find objects they manage, so you just have to make sure the new controller you define has the right label. Hamel: it’s not clear how to switch from a Daemonset to a deployment."

    "section": "Taint",
    "text": "Taint\nTaints are a special kind of label with a key-value pair, but it tells the scheduler that a particular node is different. For example, the master taint is applied to control plane nodes by default (so your applications will not get scheduled on this important node).\nYou can use taint to record relevant attributes about nodes, like the type of hardware. When you add a taint, workloads will not be scheduled on that node unless you add a matching toleration to the workload.\nFor example, if you add this taint to all nodes, nothing will be scheduled! Note that tainting doesn’t impact existing workloads, only future ones.\nkubectl taint nodes --all kiamol-disk=hdd:NoSchedule\nThis is how you would add the toleration to a workload:\nspec:                           # The Pod spec in a Deployment\n containers:\n   - name: sleep\n     image: kiamol/ch03-sleep      \n tolerations:                  # Lists taints this Pod is happy with\n     - key: \"kiamol-disk\"      # The key, value, and effect all need \n       operator: \"Equal\"       # to match the taint on the node.\n       value: \"hdd\"\n       effect: \"NoSchedule\"\nTaints are only for negative associations - you can’t use them to say “this node is good for this workload”. For that, you need to use nodeSelector or nodeAffinity. You would not use a taint so say a workload should run on a GPU node, for example.\nThis is an example of using NodeSelector:\nspec:\n containers:\n   - name: sleep\n     image: kiamol/ch03-sleep      \n tolerations:                            # The Pod tolerates nodes \n   - key: \"kiamol-disk\"                  # with the hdd taint.\n     operator: \"Equal\"\n     value: \"hdd\"\n     effect: \"NoSchedule\"\n nodeSelector:                           # The Pod will run only on nodes\n   kubernetes.io/arch: zxSpectrum        # that match this CPU type.\nThe arch example are automatically set by Kubernetes on each node. For example, on my laptop if I do kl get nodes -o yaml it will have the key,value pair archictecture: arm64 under nodeInfo."

    "text": "SML (Standard ML) Part A\n\nYou setup vim to have an IDE for this. See notes in the VIM section below.\nML is a statically typed language with magical type inference that works really well. It automatically determines the types and is very intuitive and helpful.\nLearned how to use recursion everywhere instead of loops, particularly with hd, tl and cons.\nLocal variable binding with let is very important (which also allows you to bind local/private functions as well)\ncons allows you to append to the beginning of a list\nThere is an option type that is NONE or SOME v\nThis language doesn’t encourage mutation, which is a feature. Otherwise, you can use a reference which is like a pointer to mutate a variable.\npattern matching with a case expression: This is one of the coolest things that I learned, and something similar is coming to Python v 3.10.\n\nYou can have nested patterns\nYou can pattern match against function arguments which allow for really nice syntax for achieving multiple dispatch type of functionality.. (not sure about python)\nYou can pattern match against types as well as data structures.\nYou can have constants in there as well.\n\ncase name \n     NameType name => ...\n   | (first, \"MyLastName\") => ...\n   | (first, last) => ...\n   | name => ...\n   | _ => ...\nTail recursion with accumulators. Ex- factorial\nThe fn keyword is used to define anonymous functions.\nML uses lexical scope which means function is evaluated in the environment where the function was defined. dynamic scope, which is usually not desired, is the alternative where the function is evaluated in the in the environment it is called.\nClosure - the call stack has a “pair” that is the (function, environment when the function was defined). This pair is called the closure. The call stack has a snapshot of what the environment looked like at the time the function was defined.\nfold is like reduce.\nML supports function composition like this with the keyword o: f1 o f2 o f3\n\nbest to do a val binding to avoid unnecessary wrapping: val newfunc = f1 o f2\nwith o you apply functions from right to left so f1 o f2 x is the same as f1(f2(x)) there is an alternative that is left to right called the pipeline operator.\n\nCurrying and partial application\n\nUniversal way to make a func curryable: ml       fun myfunc x           let fun f2 (z) = z               fun f1 (y) = f2(y)           begin               f1           end\nML has first class support for currying so you don’t have to do the above hack.\n\nML supports mutual recursion just like let-rec in racket."

    "text": "Racket (Part B)\nRacket is related to Lisp and Scheme. Everything is a function. Parenthesis for everything. The position of parenthesis changes the meaning of the code.\n\nRacket has dynamic typing, unlike SML.\nThunks: Wrap a function in a zero argument function to delay evaluation. Applications:\n\nStreams: the function will return a tuple of (value, func), and when you call func it will return (value, func) so you get one value at a time. This is not specific to Racket.\nLazy evaluation: You can use thunks to delay execution like a promise to a later time. This is an example of lazy evalution that doesn’t actually evaluate anything until being forced to:\n\n\n(define (my-delay f) (mcons #f f))\n\n(define (my-force th)\n\n(if (mcar th) (mcdr th) (begin (set-mcar! th #t) (set-mcdr! th ((mcdr th))) (mcdr th))))\nRacket allows you use macros that will evaluate before the code is run and that will “expand” into valid racket syntax.\nYou implemented your own small programming language. This used recursive calls to evluate expressions with the base case being the values (Integer, strings, etc). - Interperter: write a program in another language A that takes programs in B and produces answers directly. A better term would be “evaluator”. - Compiler: write program in another language A that takes programs in B and produces an equivalent program in langauage C. A better term here would be “translator”.\nClosures: for lexical scope, the interpreter has a stack of tuples. The tuples are (1) the function to be called (2) the environment, which contains the value of all variables at the time the function was defined. You also have to track the arguments for the function seperately, so you can evaluate the arguments in the environment the function was run in."

    "text": "Ruby (Part C)\nI didn’t spend too much time some concepts I was mostly familiar with this.\n\nRuby is OOP, dynamically typed.\nRuby is pure OOP, even top level functions and variables are part of the built-in Object class.\nThey have fastcore like shortcuts for getters and setters:\n\nattr_reader :y, :z # defines getters \nattr_accessor :x # defines getters and setters\nnewlines are important. The syntax can change without them.\nDynamic class definitions. The following code will result in Class with the methods foo and bar! The second one doesn’t override the first one!\nclass Class\n    def foo\n        ...\n    end\nend\n\nclass Class\n    def bar\n        ...\n    end\nend\n\nBlocks\nThey also have a very convenient lambda like thing called Blocks:\nsum = 0 \n[4,6,8].each { |x| sum += x \n               puts sum }\nYou can use Blocks to make accumulators too, and even use inject to initialize the accumulator:\nsum = [4,6,8].inject(0) { |acc,elt| acc + elt }\nTo use blocks in a method, you will have to look that up in the docs. This involves the yield keyword. For example, this code will print “hi” 3 times:\ndef foo x \n  if x \n    yield \n   else \n    yield \n    yield \n   end \nend \n\nfoo (true) { puts \"hi\" } \nfoo (false) { puts \"hi\" }\nBlocks are not first class functions even though they kind of look like lambdas. Lets say you wanted to map over an array but wanted to return an array of functions instead of values. The way to do this is to use the keyword lambda:\nc = a.map {|x| {|y| x >= y} } # wrong, a syntax error\n\nc = a.map {|x| lambda {|y| x >= y} } # this will work\n\nSubclassing\n\nsuper calls the same method in the parent class. You dont have to do super.method_name(), just super.\nInstance variables are preceeded with @\n\nChild classes are defined like this:\nclass Child < Parent\n ...\nend\n\n\n\nTyping\nThey discussed the various ways different type systems are constructed. The interface idiom, that is familar to you from Golang (but not specific to Golang) was introduced."

    "text": "Improving the model\n\nLearning Rate Finder\nStart with a very, very small learning rate, something so small that we would never expect it to be too big to handle. We use that for one mini-batch, find what the losses are afterwards, and then increase the learning rate by some percentage (e.g., doubling it each time). Then we do another mini-batch, track the loss, and double the learning rate again. We keep doing this until the loss gets worse, instead of better. This is the point where we know we have gone too far. We then select a learning rate a bit lower than this point. Our advice is to pick either:\n\nOne order of magnitude less than where the minimum loss was achieved (i.e., the minimum divided by 10)\nThe last point where the loss was clearly decreasing\n\nThe learning rate finder computes those points and more on the curve to help you. Additional learning rate suggestion algorithms can be passed into the function, by default only the valley paradigm is used. The learning rate finder can be called with learn.lr_find:\n>>> learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)\n>>> lr_min, lr_steep, lr_valley, lr_slide = learn.lr_find(suggest_funcs=(minimum, steep, valley, slide))\n\nThe default valley hueristic works just fine. Note, you will want to re-run this anytime you change your model such as unfreeze layers. You might want to run this periodically if you are checkpointing during training.\n\n\nFine Tuning models\nWhen we create a model from a pretrained network fastai automatically freezes all of the pretrained layers for us. When we call the fine_tune method fastai does two things:\n\nTrains the randomly added layers for one epoch, with all other layers frozen\nUnfreezes all of the layers, and trains them all for the number of epochs requested\n\nAlthough this is a reasonable default approach, it is likely that for your particular dataset you may get better results by doing things slightly differently. The fine_tune method has a number of parameters you can use to change its behavior, but it might be easiest for you to just call the underlying methods directly if you want to get some custom behavior.\nfit_one_cycle is the suggested way to train models without using fine_tune. We’ll see why later in the book; in short, what fit_one_cycle does is to start training at a low learning rate, gradually increase it for the first section of training, and then gradually decrease it again for the last section of training.\nlearn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(3, 3e-3) # train the head\nlearn.unfreeze() # unfreeze everything\nlearn.lr_find() # find new lr after unfreezing\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(6, lr_max=1e-5) #fine tune it all\n\n\nDiscriminative Learning Rates\nOne important aspect of fine tuning is discriminative learning rates: use a lower learning rate for the early layers of the neural network, and a higher learning rate for the later layers (and especially the randomly added layers).\nfastai lets you pass a Python slice object anywhere that a learning rate is expected. The first value passed will be the learning rate in the earliest layer of the neural network, and the second value will be the learning rate in the final layer. The layers in between will have learning rates that are multiplicatively equidistant throughout that range. Let’s use this approach to replicate the previous training, but this time we’ll only set the lowest layer of our net to a learning rate of 1e-6; the other layers will scale up to 1e-4. Let’s train for a while and see what happens:\nlearn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(3, 3e-3)\nlearn.unfreeze()\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(12, lr_max=slice(1e-6,1e-4))\nWe can accomplish everything we did above by calling fine_tune instead. fine_tune will automatically apply discriminative learning rates for you:\n>>> learn.fine_tune??\nSignature:\nlearn.fine_tune(\n    epochs,\n    base_lr=0.002,\n    freeze_epochs=1,\n    lr_mult=100,\n    pct_start=0.3,\n    div=5.0,\n    lr_max=None,\n    div_final=100000.0,\n    wd=None,\n    moms=None,\n    cbs=None,\n    reset_opt=False,\n)\nSource:   \n@patch\n@delegates(Learner.fit_one_cycle)\ndef fine_tune(self:Learner, epochs, base_lr=2e-3, freeze_epochs=1, lr_mult=100,\n              pct_start=0.3, div=5.0, **kwargs):\n    \"Fine tune with `Learner.freeze` for `freeze_epochs`, then with `Learner.unfreeze` for `epochs`, using discriminative LR.\"\n    self.freeze()\n    self.fit_one_cycle(freeze_epochs, slice(base_lr), pct_start=0.99, **kwargs)\n    base_lr /= 2\n    self.unfreeze()\n    self.fit_one_cycle(epochs, slice(base_lr/lr_mult, base_lr), pct_start=pct_start, div=div, **kwargs)\nFile:      ~/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages/fastai/callback/schedule.py\nType:      method"

Can do this with list(zip(x,y))\nDataLoader: an iterator that provides a stream of minibatches of (x,y) instead of a single item.\nDatasets: object that contains a training Dataset and a Validation dataset.\nDataLoaders: object that contains a training DataLoader and a validation DataLoader.\n\n\nCreating Datsets\nYou can use a DataBlock:\n>>> from fastbook import *\n>>> from fastai.vision.all import *\n\n>>> path = untar_data(URLs.PASCAL_2007)\n>>> df = pd.read_csv(path/'train.csv')\n>>> def get_x(r): return path/'train'/r['fname']\n>>> def get_y(r): return r['labels'].split(' ')\n\n>>> dblock = DataBlock(get_x = get_x, get_y = get_y)\n>>> dsets = dblock.datasets(df)\n>>> dsets.train[0]\n\n(Path('/home/hamel/.fastai/data/pascal_2007/train/006162.jpg'), ['aeroplane'])\nNext we need to convert our images into tensors. We can do this by using the ImageBlock and MultiCategoryBlock:\n\n\nUsing Blocks For Transforms\n>>> dblock = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock, MultiCategoryBlock),\n                       get_x = get_x, get_y = get_y)\n>>> dsets = dblock.datasets(df)\n>>> dsets.train[0]\n\n(PILImage mode=RGB size=500x333,\n TensorMultiCategory([0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]))\n\n\nInspecting Vocabulary\nYou can inspect the vocabulary with the vocab attribute:\ndsets.train.vocab\n\n\nUsing a splitter\nThe dataframe has a column called is_valid, we can use that do a train validation split. By default, the DataBlock uses a RandomSplitter. By default, RandomSplitter uses 20% of the data for the validation set.\ndef splitter(df):\n    train = df.index[~df['is_valid']].tolist()\n    valid = df.index[df['is_valid']].tolist()\n    return train,valid\n\ndblock = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock, MultiCategoryBlock),\n                   splitter=splitter,\n                   get_x=get_x, \n                   get_y=get_y)\n\ndsets = dblock.datasets(df)\n\n\nCreating DataLoaders\nDataLoaders build upon Datasets by streaming mini-batches instead of one example at a time. One prerequisite to making DataLoaders is that all the images are the same size. To do this you can use RandomResizedCrop:\ndblock = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock, MultiCategoryBlock),\n                   splitter=splitter,\n                   get_x=get_x, \n                   get_y=get_y,\n                   item_tfms = RandomResizedCrop(128, min_scale=0.35))\ndls = dblock.dataloaders(df)\nWhen you are done with this, you want to debug things by calling show_batch:\ndls.show_batch(nrows=1, ncols=3)"

In fact, it provides a number of versions, with rather confusing names!\nF.binary_cross_entropy and its module equivalent nn.BCELoss calculate cross-entropy on a one-hot-encoded target, but do not include the initial sigmoid. Normally for one-hot-encoded targets you’ll want F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits (or nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss), which do both sigmoid and binary cross-entropy in a single function, as in the preceding example.\nThe equivalent for single-label datasets (like MNIST or the Pet dataset), where the target is encoded as a single integer, is F.nll_loss or nn.NLLLoss for the version without the initial softmax, and F.cross_entropy or nn.CrossEntropyLoss for the version with the initial softmax.\nSince we have a one-hot-encoded target, we will use BCEWithLogitsLoss:\nloss_func = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()\nloss = loss_func(activs, y)\nWe don’t actually need to tell fastai to use this loss function (although we can if we want) since it will be automatically chosen for us. fastai knows that the DataLoaders has multiple category labels, so it will use nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss by default.\n\n\nMetrics\nWe need to make sure we have a metric that works for multi-label classfication:\ndef accuracy_multi(inp, targ, thresh=0.5, sigmoid=True):\n    \"Compute accuracy when `inp` and `targ` are the same size.\"\n    if sigmoid: inp = inp.sigmoid()\n    return ((inp>thresh)==targ.bool()).float().mean()\nWe can use partial to set the parameters we want in the metrics function and pass it like this:\nlearn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet50, metrics=partial(accuracy_multi, thresh=0.2))\nlearn.fine_tune(3, base_lr=3e-3, freeze_epochs=4)\nYou can change your metrics anytime and recalculate things. validate() will return the validation loss and metrics.\n>>> learn.metrics = partial(accuracy_multi, thresh=0.1)\n>>> learn.validate() # returns validation loss and metrics\n(#2) [0.10417556017637253,0.9376891851425171]\nYou can debug metrics by getting the predictions on the validation set with get_preds:\npreds,targs = learn.get_preds()\nassert preds.shape[0] == dls.valid.n\nOnce you have the predictions, you can run the metric function seperately:\naccuracy_multi(preds, targs, thresh=0.9, sigmoid=False)\n\n\nChoosing A Prediction Threshold\nxs = torch.linspace(0.05,0.95,29)\naccs = [accuracy_multi(preds, targs, thresh=i, sigmoid=False) for i in xs]\nplt.plot(xs,accs);\n\nIn this case, we’re using the validation set to pick a hyperparameter (the threshold), which is the purpose of the validation set. Sometimes students have expressed their concern that we might be overfitting to the validation set, since we’re trying lots of values to see which is the best. However, as you see in the plot, changing the threshold in this case results in a smooth curve, so we’re clearly not picking some inappropriate outlier. This is a good example of where you have to be careful of the difference between theory (don’t try lots of hyperparameter values or you might overfit the validation set) versus practice (if the relationship is smooth, then it’s fine to do this)."

Remember way back in <> how we used y_range to tell fastai the range of our targets? We’ll do the same here - coordinates in fastai and PyTorch are always rescaled between -1 and +1 by the PointBlock, which is why you pass (-1, 1) to y_range.\n\nSetting y_range\n# Always use y_range when predicting a continous target\nlearn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18, y_range=(-1,1))\nWe didn’t specify a loss function, which means we’re getting whatever fastai chooses as the default.\n>>> dls.loss_func\nFlattenedLoss of MSELoss()\nNote also that we didn’t specify any metrics. That’s because the MSE is already a useful metric for this task (although it’s probably more interpretable after we take the square root).\n\nYou should always set y_range when predicting continuous targets. y_range is implemented in fastai using sigmoid_range, which is defined as:\ndef sigmoid_range(x, lo, hi): return torch.sigmoid(x) * (hi-lo) + lo\nThis is set as the final layer of the model, if y_range is defined. Take a moment to think about what this function does, and why it forces the model to output activations in the range (lo,hi).\nHere’s what it looks like:\nplot_function(partial(sigmoid_range,lo=-1,hi=1), min=-4, max=4)\n\n\n\n\nFind the learning rate and then train\nlearn.lr_find()\nlr = 1e-2\nlearn.fine_tune(3, lr)\n\n\nInspect the Results\nlearn.show_results(ds_idx=1, nrows=3, figsize=(6,8))"

This is different than .bashrc.\n\ncommonly loads the ~/.bashrc file as well.\nbin is traditionally the folder for binaries.\nbash_profile is designed to run when you login, so if you change it will not refresh until you login next time.\n\n\n\n\n\n.bashrc it is executed simply before the command shell comes up, does not have to wait until you login.\netc/bashrc are system bashrc files which is like a “template” for user bashrc files. Anytime a new user is created, it inherits from this template and sometimes automated customizations are applied. This is usually done by simply importing etc/bashrc from each user’s bashrc file.\nenv will list all env variables.\nto apply .bashrc you just have to run the command bash as it will start another shell from your current one. However, if you run bash you can now exit without closing the shell, because a shell is running inside another shell.\n\n\n\n\n\n~/.bash_history contains lots of history. By default will only capture last 100 but you can change this setting.\n\nyou can exlude something from saving to history (like passwords) by using an ignorespace\nthe environment variable HIST_CONTROL can be used to control how much history to keep and settings about what should not be logged. One way to turn off loggin is: bash     export HISTCONTROL=$HISTCONTROL:ignorespace this allow you to skip logging by adding a space to the the beginning of any command. If you want to see what is in HIST_CONTROL you will see:\n> cat ~/.bash_history | grep HISTCONTROL\nHISTCONTROL=ignoredups:ignorespace\nignoredups was already set to this variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nDoesn’t always exist on a system. in most cases the contents of the ~/.bash_logout will be empty or contain a comment.\nThe role of this file is to execute things when you exit the shell. If you close the shell it will not work, you have to do a clean exit instead.\nCommon use is to use this to clear out ~/.bashrc with the original to clear out any changes the user may have made. You can accomplish this by copying a backup:\ncp ~/.bashrc.original ~/.bashrc\n\n\n\n\n\nPut your shell scripts in a folder you can find them. We can put them in ~/bin:\n> mkdir bin\nMake sure in ~/.bash_profile you have:\nPATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin\nexport PATH\n\n\n\nTo make test.sh executable run command chmod u+x test.sh\n\nYou can also run chmod 755\n\n\n\n\ncan use any name that is not an environment variable (check with env).\nby convention variable names in ALLCAPS. bash     > FIRSTNAME=\"Hamel\"\n  - No space b/w = and value.\n  - Good idea to __always__ put value in double quotes `\"`, although this is not required in every case.  \nAs a practice you want to use export command to set is as an environment variable. This makes the variable available to any subprocess that starts from the shell. Read more about this here.\n> export FIRSTNAME\n> echo \"Hello, $FIRSTNAME\"\n\"Hello Hamel\"\n\n> export FIRSTNAME=\"Hamel\" # do this in one step\nThe above example could work without export, too just reinforcing that its a good idea to use this as a habit. You can do this in one step:\n\n\n\n> export TODAYSDATE=`date`  # executes date command\n\n\n\n\n```bash\nMYUSERNAME='hamel'\nMYPASSWORD='password'\nSTARTOFSCRIPT=`date`\n\necho \"My login name for this app is $MYUSERNAME\"\necho \"My login password for this app is $MYPASSWORD\"\necho \"I started this script at $STARTOFSCRIPT\"\n\nENDOFSCRIPT=`date`\n\necho \"I ended the script at $ENDOFSCRIPT\"\n```\n\nThese variables only live within the sub-shell that executes the script.\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod 1 (Static): Assign command result to variable. Only runs the command at time of variable assignment.\n\n    TODAYSDATE=`date`\n    USERFILES=`find /home -user user` # find all directories owned by the user \"user\"\n\n    echo \"Today's Date: $TODAYSDATE\"\n    echo \"All files owned by USER: $USERFILES\"\n\nMethod 2: Use an alias, which allows you to run a command every time you call the alias. For aliases to work this way you must use the shopt command, which allows aliases to be useable in shell scripts. Technically referred to as “expanding aliases within a subshell”.\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    shopt -s expand_aliases\n\n    # notice that we don't use backticks here because the command we want to execute is put in \"..\"\n    alias TODAY=\"date\" \n    alias UFILES=\"find /home -user user\"\n\n\n    A=`TODAY` #Executes the command date\n    B=`UFILES`#Executes the command \n    echo \"With Alias, TODAY is: $A\" echo \"With Alias, UFILES is: $B\"\n\n\n\n\nValue = 0 means everything is ok\nValue != 0 means something is wrong.\nSee last exit status w/ the $? command:\n\n    > ls\n    > echo $?\n    0\n\n\n\nUnlike python, shell scripts will continue executing even if there is an error. You can prevent this by using set -e\n\n    set -e # means exit the shell if there is an error, don't continue.\n\n\n\n\n    expr 1 + 2\n    expr 2 \\* 2 # you have to escape the *\n    expr \\( 2 + 2 \\) \\* 4  # you must also escape the ( )\n\nCaveat: You need a space on each side of the operator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nenv and printenv will tell you your global vars\nset will give you things from your session. This will also usually contain everything from your global scope. set is a superset of env.\nReserved names: see study guide or google it.\n\n\n\nunset MY_VAR\n\n\n\n\n\n$ escapes a single character.\nsingle quotes '..' treats something as a string, escapes the whole thing\ndouble quotes do not escape anything.\n\n> echo \"\\$COL\"  # this will escape the $\n$COL\n\n> echo '$COL' # single quotes escape things, means the literal string\n$COL\n\n> echo \"$COL\" # does not escape anything\n250\n\n> echo \"The date is: `date`\" # command substitution with bacticks\nThe date is Mon Jul 25"

    "section": "Managing Processes (ps, kill, pkill)",
    "text": "Managing Processes (ps, kill, pkill)\n\nKill Single Process (ps, kill)\nA common scenario is that you might run a python script to train a model:\n$ python train.py\nLet’s say you want to kill this script for whatever reason. You might not always be able to type Cntrl + C to stop it, especially if this process is running in the background. (Aside: A way make a program run in the background is with a & for example:$ python train.py & )\nIn order to find this running program, you can use the command ps\n$ ps Gives you basic information (good enough most of the time)\nFlags:\n\n-e Allows you to see all running processes including from other users\n-f Allows you to see additional information about each process\n\nIn order to kill the process you will want to identify it’s PID for example, if the PID is 501 you can kill this process with the command:\n$ kill 501\n\n\nKilling Multiple Processes (pkill)\nIf you use process-based threading in python with a library like multi-processing, python will instantiate many processes for you. This is common thing to do in python for a task like data processing.\nLet’s consider the below example. When you run this in the background it will produce 8 processes:\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\nfrom time import sleep\n\ndef f(x):\n    sleep(1000) # simulate some computation\n    return x*x\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    with Pool(8) as p:\n        print(p.map(f, range(8)))\n\n$ python train_multi.py &\n\nAfter a few seconds, calling the command ps will yield something like this:\nPID TTY           TIME CMD\n 3982 ttys002    0:00.09 ...MacOS/Python train_multi.py\n 4219 ttys002    0:00.00 ...MacOS/Python train_multi.py\n 4220 ttys002    0:00.00 ...MacOS/Python train_multi.py\n 4221 ttys002    0:00.00 ...MacOS/Python train_multi.py\n 4222 ttys002    0:00.00 ...MacOS/Python train_multi.py\n 4223 ttys002    0:00.00 ...MacOS/Python train_multi.py\n 4224 ttys002    0:00.00 ...MacOS/Python train_multi.py\n 4225 ttys002    0:00.00 ...MacOS/Python train_multi.py\n 4226 ttys002    0:00.00 ...MacOS/Python train_multi.py\nYou can find all processes with the file train_multi.py with the pkill command and the -f flag:\n\n\n\nSee Parent / Child Processes (pstree)\npstree is also a helpful utility to see parent/child relationships between processes. You can install pstree on a mac with brew install pstree\nIn the above example, there are 8 sub-processes created by one python process. Running the command\n$ pstree -s train_multi.py\nWill show the process hierarchy. The -s flag allows you to filter parents and descendants of processes containing a string in their command. In the below example, PID 41592 will kill all the 8 child processes seen below\n\n\n\nKilling Process Options\n\nReminder: view processes with ps or top To show processes from all users ps aux\n\nTo restart pid 6996 kill -1 6996\nkill pid 6996 kill -9 6996\n\nYou can kill processes by name (which is also usually listed as the command that started the processes). killall will search for the string int he relevant process.\n\n\nBringing processes back into the foreground\nReminder you put processes in the background with & example is myscript.sh &\nYou can move processes back into the foreground with fg\nfg 1234 brings process 1234 back into the foreground."

    "section": "Bundling & Archiving Files (tar)",
    "text": "Bundling & Archiving Files (tar)\nYou commonly want to package a bunch of files together, such as a collection of photos or CSVs, and optionally compress these with its directory structure intact. A common tool for this is tar . This is how you would bundle and compress a directory of CSV files:\n\n\nSending An Archive To A Remote Machine\nIt is often the case you want to send data to a remote machine. The below command creates a directory called data , compresses all files in a local folder named csv_data , with the exception of the sub-directory csv_data/intermediate_files without creating any temporary files locally:\nOptionally, create the directory on the remote machine:\n\nThen, stream the archive directly to remote. Note that providing a — instead of a destination filename allows tar to write to a stream (stdout) that can be sent directly to the remote server.\n\n\n\nMoving Files In Different Directories Into An Archive\nIf your files exist in sibling directories, rather than under one parent directory you can use find along with tar . Suppose you want to archive all csv files relative to a directory:\n\nWhen you archive files on the fly above with find you cannot compress the files until the archive is finished being built, therefore you have to compress the tar file with the gzip command:\n\n$ gzip data.tar\n\nTip: some people like to use locate with updatedb instead of find. There are tradeoffs so make sure you read the documentation carefully!\n\n\nUnpacking & Decompressing Archives\nYou can decompress and unpack a tar file, for example data.tar.gz with the following command:\n\n$ tar -xzvf data.tar.gz\n\nIf the data is not compressed, you can leave out the -z flag:\n\n$ tar -xvf data.tar"

    "section": "File Permissions",
    "text": "File Permissions\nBefore we begin, we must introduce some nomenclature:\n\nIf you run the command ls -a you will see something similar to the below output for all of your files in the current directory.\n\nThe file permissions are shown in three-character groupings for three different groups (nine characters total). These three groups are the owner , group , and other users. In this case, the owner name is hamel and the group name is staff\nFor the owner, the file permissions are rwx which means that the owner has read r , write w , and execute x permissions.\nFor the group, the file permissions are r-x which means the group has read and execute permissions, but not write permissions. A group is a collection of users with common permissions.\nFinally, all other users have file permissions of r– which means only read permissions.\n\nChanging File Permissions\nThere are several ways to change file permissions.\nMethod 1: Using Characters and +, -\nRefer to the nomenclature above to follow along\n\nchmod o-r csvfiles.tar.gz\nRemoves - the ability of other users o to read r the file.\nchmod g+w csvfiles.tar.gz\nAdds + the ability of the group g to write w to the file.\nchmod u+x csvfiles.tar.gz\nAdds + the ability of the owner u to execute x the file.\nchomd a+x csvfiles.tar.gz\nAdds + the ability of all users a to execute x the file.\n\nMethod 2: using numbers\nThis method works by adding up the numbers corresponding to the permissions separately for each user group (owner, group, others). For example:\n\nchmod 777 csvfiles.tar.gz\nThis gives all users the ability to read (4), write( 2), and execute (1) files. In other words 4+2+1 = 7, for the owner, group and other users.\nchmod 732 csvfiles.tar.gz\nThis gives the owner the ability to read, write and execute ( 4+2+1=7), the group the ability to write and execute (2+1=3) and all other users only the ability to write (2).\n\n\n\nChanging Ownership\nYou can change the owner or group assigned to a file like this:\nchown newuser:newgroup file\nThe :newgroup is optional, if you do not specify that the group will stay the same."
