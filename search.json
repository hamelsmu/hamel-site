You can change the syntax color theme in either your front matter or site-wide in _quarto.yml like this:\n\nFront Matter_quarto.yml\n\n\n---\nhighlight-style: custom.theme\n---\nIf you have both light and dark themes, you will likely want to set those separately like this:\n---\nhighlight-style:\n  light: custom-light.theme\n  dark: custom-dark.theme\n---\n\n\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: \n      light: assets/ek-theme-light.scss\n      dark: assets/ek-theme-dark.scss\n    highlight-style: \n      light: assets/ek-light.theme\n      dark: assets/ek-dark.theme\n\n\n\n\nThese color themes are defined by json files with the schema defined here. However, it is recommended that you choose one of the themes that quarto already provides and edit that. By default, Quarto uses the arrow-light theme. This means if you are happy with the way Quarto is highlighting syntax, you can just tweak this theme. Personally, my favorite theme is dracula. It is useful to look through these different themes to get a sense of the types of things you can change.",

    "section": "2. Syntax Definitions",
    "text": "2. Syntax Definitions\nSyntax definitions define the rules by which syntax is highlighted. A rule is a string, character or regular expression against which to match the text being analyzed. This is helpful if you need to document a language that isn’t supported by Quarto out of the box. You can see the list of supported languages with this command:\nquarto pandoc --list-highlight-languages\nSyntax definitions are defined in xml files that follow this schema. Examples of syntax definitions for various languages can be found here.\nQuarto has additional example syntax definitions here which are useful to look at. Note how the name of the language and its file extensions are defined in the XML file.\nIn order to supply an additional syntax definition or override an existing one, set the syntax-definitions in your _quarto.yml file like this:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    syntax-definitions: \n    - new_language.xml\n\nAn example of defining a new language is illustrated below.\n\nExample\nSuppose you have a new programming language called Fomo that is just like Python, except you can define functions with fomo in addition to def. For example, consider this Python code:\ndef hello_world():\n    \"An example\"\n    pass\nUnfortunately, If you try to use the Python code fence for Fomo it looks like this:\nfomo hello_world():\n    \"An example\"\n    pass\nSince Fomo is almost identical to Python, you can start by copying the python syntax definition into a file named fomo.xml and edit the language name, style and extension fields like so:\n\n\nfomo.xml\n\n- &lt;language name=\"Python\" version=\"26\" style=\"python\" indenter=\"python\" kateversion=\"5.0\" section=\"Scripts\" extensions=\"*.py;*.pyw;*.pyi;SConstruct;SConscript;*.FCMacro\" ...\n+ &lt;language name=\"Fomo\" version=\"26\" style=\"fomo\" indenter=\"python\" kateversion=\"5.0\" section=\"Scripts\" extensions=\"*.fomo\" ...\n\nYou also have to add fomo to the list of defs like this:\n\n\nfomo.xml\n\n        &lt;list name=\"defs\"&gt;\n            &lt;item&gt;class&lt;/item&gt;\n            &lt;item&gt;def&lt;/item&gt;\n+           &lt;item&gt;fomo&lt;/item&gt;\n            &lt;item&gt;del&lt;/item&gt;\n            &lt;item&gt;global&lt;/item&gt;\n            &lt;item&gt;lambda&lt;/item&gt;\n            &lt;item&gt;nonlocal&lt;/item&gt;\n        &lt;/list&gt;\n\nAfter that, you can add the Fomo syntax definition to your Quarto project with the syntax-definitions option like so:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nformat:\n  html:\n    syntax-definitions: \n    - fomo.xml\n\nIn this case, fomo.xml is in the root of the Quarto project, but you can put it in a sub-folder as well.\nAfter doing this, you can use the ```fomo code fence, and your code will be highlighted correctly!\nfomo hello_world():\n    \"An example\"\n    pass",

    "section": "Async Processing",
    "text": "Async Processing\nOn a completely separate note, we can use async processing, which is very similar to threads. The main benefit of async over threads is that async is easier to debug (stacktrace, breakpoints, etc).\nIn the code below, we are calling openai library with asyncio. You will see that async is faster than sync in this case, because the majority of the work involves waiting for the response, which is perfect for async\n\nimport asyncio\nimport time\nfrom openai import AsyncOpenAI, OpenAI\n\nprompts = [\"Tell me a joke\", \"What's the capital of France?\", \"Explain quantum computing\", \"How many planets are in the solar system?\", \"What is the meaning of life?\", \"How many bytes are in a kilobyte?\", \"When was the first iPhone released?\", \"What is the capital of Canada?\", \"What is the capital of Australia?\", \"What is the capital of the United Kingdom?\"]\n\n\nasync def async_process_prompt(client, prompt):\n    response = await client.chat.completions.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}]\n    )\n    return response.choices[0].message.content\n\ndef sync_process_prompt(client, prompt):\n    response = client.chat.completions.create(\n        model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n        messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": prompt}]\n    )\n    return response.choices[0].message.content\n\nasync def async_main():\n    client = AsyncOpenAI()\n    start_time = time.time()\n    tasks = [async_process_prompt(client, prompt) for prompt in prompts]\n    # you can modify this code (see below) if you wish to just run this completely in the background.\n    await asyncio.gather(*tasks) \n    end_time = time.time()\n    async_time = end_time - start_time\n    print(f\"Async processing time: {async_time:.2f} seconds\")\n    return async_time\n\ndef sync_main():\n    client = OpenAI()\n    start_time = time.time()\n    results = [sync_process_prompt(client, prompt) for prompt in prompts]\n    end_time = time.time()\n    sync_time = end_time - start_time\n    print(f\"Sync processing time: {sync_time:.2f} seconds\")\n    return sync_time\n\nsync_time = sync_main()\nasync_time = await async_main()\n\nSync processing time: 9.15 seconds\nAsync processing time: 3.99 seconds\n\n\n\n# Compare execution times\nprint(f\"\\nSynchronous execution time: {sync_time:.2f} seconds\")\nprint(f\"Asynchronous execution time: {async_time:.2f} seconds\")\nprint(f\"Time saved with async: {sync_time - async_time:.2f} seconds\")\nprint(f\"Speedup factor: {sync_time / async_time:.2f}x\")\n\n\nSynchronous execution time: 9.15 seconds\nAsynchronous execution time: 3.99 seconds\nTime saved with async: 5.16 seconds\nSpeedup factor: 2.29x\n\n\nIn the code above, async is only as slow as the slowest single task. calling await asyncio.gather(*tasks) waits until all tasks are finished. However, if you just want to run tasks in the background, you can make the following change:.\n- tasks = [async_process_prompt(client, prompt) for prompt in prompts]\n- await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n+ tasks = [asyncio.create_task(async_process_prompt(client, prompt)) for prompt in prompts]\n\nLimiting Async Tasks\nTo limit the number of tasks that can be running concurrently, we can use a asyncio.Semaphore. A semaphore allows us to control access to a shared resource, in this case, the number of concurrent tasks. 1 Here’s how it works:\n\nimport asyncio\n\n# Create a semaphore with the maximum number of concurrent tasks\nmax_concurrent_tasks = 5\nsemaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(max_concurrent_tasks)\n\nasync def limited_task(task_id):\n    async with semaphore:\n        print(f\"Starting task {task_id}\")\n        await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate some work\n        print(f\"Finished task {task_id}\")\n\n\ntasks = [limited_task(i) for i in range(5)]\n_ = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)\n\nStarting task 0\nStarting task 1\nStarting task 2\nStarting task 3\nStarting task 4\nFinished task 0\nFinished task 1\nFinished task 2\nFinished task 3\nFinished task 4",

    "text": "How do I handle AI coding assistance when FastHTML isn’t as well-known as React/Next.js?\n\nDevelopers worry about “swimming upstream” by choosing FastHTML when AI assistants like Claude and GPT-4 have much better training on mainstream frameworks.\n\nThe solution is investing in good cursor rules and context files. Isaac shared that he uses detailed cursor rules for FastHTML that provide examples and patterns. He notes: “if you give the right context to the model…it does a lot better.” The companion repo includes these cursor rule files that help AI understand FastHTML patterns.\nWade from the Discord added another perspective: “Cursor + good cursor rules has proven to be a good combo for me personally.” The key is that with FastHTML, you’re working with ~80 lines of code for a functional annotation app versus hundreds more with other frameworks. This smaller codebase is easier to understand and debug when AI suggestions go wrong.\nAs Isaac put it: “I find that with pure vibe coding, I start out with super fast progress then my iteration speed slowly gets worse over time until I get really frustrated.” With FastHTML plus good context, you maintain consistent development velocity.",

    "text": "How should I handle disagreements between annotators in my annotation app?\n\nAnnotation disagreements are inevitable, but the workflow for resolving them depends on whether you’re refining the rubric or just collecting labels. Many teams struggle with when to show annotations to other reviewers.\n\nAnswer: The approach depends on your goals. Shreya explains: “If you truly want independent annotations from annotators, yes you might want to hide comments. But sometimes the annotators are jointly working together to review a large amount of traces…and showing the comments standardizes interpretations of good and bad between annotators.”\nIsaac’s implementation takes a pragmatic approach: “Eventually we need to decide what score to assign to it. We could do a second round where annotators cannot peek at other comments. However, in the AnkiHub case, they found that annotator disagreements often stemed from incomplete rubrics.” This highlights a key principle - if you’re still defining what “good” looks like, facilitating discussion between annotators helps refine the rubric. Once the rubric is stable, you might want more independent annotation.\nThe FastHTML app Isaac built handles this with a “finalized” step where disagreements trigger a review process with comments, allowing annotators to explain their reasoning and reach consensus.",

Isaac elaborated that “FastHTML is more flexible and a full web app. If you feel like you have some really custom or unusual things that might be tricky to get right, maybe not streamlit.”\nThe key differentiator is state management complexity. As discussed in the Discord, “state management in streamlit is a nightmare if you have anything a bit complex.” For simple annotation interfaces with minimal state, Streamlit works fine. But once you need features like multi-step workflows, keyboard shortcuts for rapid annotation, or custom UI components, FastHTML’s flexibility becomes valuable.\nThe choice depends on your needs - start with Streamlit if it meets your requirements, but be prepared to switch to FastHTML if you hit limitations.",

The .json file contains the most detailed information about the diarization, with world-level predictions, whereas the .vtt and .srt files will contain a more human-readable transcript with speaker labels.

Seems to me \\\nto be a great company that cares about their customers \\\nand products. \n\"\"\"\n\n# review for an electric toothbrush\nreview_3 = \"\"\"\nMy dental hygienist recommended an electric toothbrush, \\\nwhich is why I got this.

After initial charging and \\\nleaving the charger plugged in for the first week to \\\ncondition the battery, I've unplugged the charger and \\\nbeen using it for twice daily brushing for the last \\\n3 weeks all on the same charge. But the toothbrush head \\\nis too small. I’ve seen baby toothbrushes bigger than \\\nthis one. I wish the head was bigger with different \\\nlength bristles to get between teeth better because \\\nthis one doesn’t.  Overall if you can get this one \\\naround the $50 mark, it's a good deal. The manufactuer's \\\nreplacements heads are pretty expensive, but you can \\\nget generic ones that're more reasonably priced.

And the 11 piece system went up around $10 or \\\nso in price also from the earlier sale price of $29. \\\nSo it looks okay, but if you look at the base, the part \\\nwhere the blade locks into place doesn’t look as good \\\nas in previous editions from a few years ago, but I \\\nplan to be very gentle with it (example, I crush \\\nvery hard items like beans, ice, rice, etc. in the \\ \nblender first then pulverize them in the serving size \\\nI want in the blender then switch to the whipping \\\nblade for a finer flour, and use the cross cutting blade \\\nfirst when making smoothies, then use the flat blade \\\nif I need them finer/less pulpy).

You can do this in python as follows:\n# Turn mnist data into vectors 3dim -&gt; 2dim\ntrain_x = torch.cat([stacked_threes, stacked_sevens]).view(-1, 28*28)\n# Generate label tensor\ntrain_y = tensor([1]*len(threes) + [0]*len(sevens)).unsqueeze(1)\n# Create dataset\ndset = list(zip(train_x,train_y))\n\n# See shapes from first datum in the dataset\n&gt;&gt;&gt; x,y = dset[0]\n&gt;&gt;&gt; x.shape, y.shape\n(torch.Size([784]), torch.Size([1]))\n\n\n# Do the same thing for the validation set\n....\n\nMini Batch SGD\n# `@` and dot product is the same:\na, b = torch.rand(10), torch.rand(10)\nassert a.dot(b) == a@b\n\n# define model\ndef init_params(size, std=1.0): \n    return (torch.randn(size)*std).requires_grad_()\nweights = init_params((28*28,1))\nbias = init_params(1)\n\ndef linear1(xb): return xb@weights + bias\n\n#naive loss (for illustration)\ncorrects = (preds&gt;0.0).float() == train_y\ncorrects.float().mean().item()\n\n# define loss\ndef mnist_loss(preds, targets):\n    preds = preds.sigmoid() #squash b/w 0 and 1\n    return torch.where(targets==1, 1-preds, preds).mean() # average distance loss\n\nCreate a dataloader\nYou want to load your data in batches, so you will want to create a dataloader. Recall that in pytorch, a Dataset is required to return a tuple of (x,y) when indexed, which is quite easy to do:\n# define a data loader using `dset`\ndset = list(zip(train_x,train_y))\nPytorch offers a utility to then create a Dataloader from a dataset, but Jeremy basically rolled his own (w/same api):\ndl = DataLoader(dset, batch_size=256)\nvalid_dl = DataLoader(valid_dset, batch_size=256)\n\n\n\nThe Training Loop\ndef calc_grad(xb, yb, model):\n    preds = model(xb)\n    loss = mnist_loss(preds, yb)\n    loss.backward()\n\ndef train_epoch(model, lr, params):\n    for xb,yb in dl:\n        calc_grad(xb, yb, model)\n        for p in params:\n            p.data -= p.grad*lr\n            p.grad.zero_() #updates in place\n\n### Calculate metrics\ndef batch_accuracy(xb, yb):\n    preds = xb.sigmoid()\n    correct = (preds&gt;0.5) == yb\n    return correct.float().mean()\n\ndef validate_epoch(model):\n    accs = [batch_accuracy(model(xb), yb) for xb,yb in valid_dl]\n    return round(torch.stack(accs).mean().item(), 4)\n\n# Train model\nlr = 1.\nparams = weights,bias\ntrain_epoch(linear1, lr, params)\nvalidate_epoch(linear1)\n\n# Train model w/epochs\nfor i in range(20):\n    train_epoch(linear1, lr, params)\n    print(validate_epoch(linear1), end=' ')\n\n\n\nUsing Pytorch\nBlueprint: 1. Define a dataset and then a dataloader 2. Create a model, which will have parameters 3. Create an optimizer, that: - Updates the params: params.data -= parmas.grad.data * lr - Zeros out the gradients: setting params.grad = None or zeroing out the gradients with params.grad.zero_() 4. Generate the predictions 5. Calculate the loss 6. Calculate the gradients loss.backward() 7. Using the optimizer, update the weights step and zero out the gradients zero_grad 8. Put 4-7 in a loop.\nCreate an optimizer and use nn.Linear\nlinear_model = nn.Linear(28*28,1)\nw,b = linear_model.parameters()\n\n# Define an optimizer\nclass BasicOptim:\n    def __init__(self,params,lr): self.params,self.lr = list(params),lr\n\n    def step(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        for p in self.params: p.data -= p.grad.data * self.lr\n\n    def zero_grad(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        for p in self.params: p.grad = None\n\nopt = BasicOptim(linear_model.parameters(), lr)\n# alternative, fastai provides SGD\nopt = SGD(linear_model.parameters(), lr)\n\n# Define Metrics\ndef batch_accuracy(xb, yb):\n    preds = xb.sigmoid()\n    correct = (preds&gt;0.5) == yb\n    return correct.float().mean()\n\n# Helper to calculate metrics on validation set\ndef validate_epoch(model):\n    accs = [batch_accuracy(model(xb), yb) for xb,yb in valid_dl]\n    return round(torch.stack(accs).mean().item(), 4)\n\ndef train_epoch(model):\n    for xb,yb in dl:\n        calc_grad(xb, yb, model)\n        opt.step()\n        opt.zero_grad()\n\n\ndef train_model(model, epochs):\n    for i in range(epochs):\n        train_epoch(model)\n        print(validate_epoch(model), end=' ')\n\n\ntrain_model(linear_model, 20)\n\nUsing fastai\nWe can substitute the above with learner.fit from fastai We just have to supply the following:\n\nDataloaders\nModel\nOptimization function\nLoss function\nMetrics\n\ndls = DataLoaders(dl, valid_dl)\nlearn = Learner(dls, nn.Linear(28*28,1), opt_func=SGD, \n                loss_func=mnist_loss,\n                metrics=batch_accuracy)\n\nlearn.fit(10, lr=lr)\nWhat if you used the full power of fastai? It would look like this:\ndls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(path)\n# Lots of things have defaults like optimization func\nlearn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18, pretrained=False,\n                    loss_func=F.cross_entropy, \n                     metrics=accuracy)\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(1, 0.1)",

    "text": "SML (Standard ML) Part A\n\nYou setup vim to have an IDE for this. See notes in the VIM section below.\nML is a statically typed language with magical type inference that works really well. It automatically determines the types and is very intuitive and helpful.\nLearned how to use recursion everywhere instead of loops, particularly with hd, tl and cons.\nLocal variable binding with let is very important (which also allows you to bind local/private functions as well)\ncons allows you to append to the beginning of a list\nThere is an option type that is NONE or SOME v\nThis language doesn’t encourage mutation, which is a feature. Otherwise, you can use a reference which is like a pointer to mutate a variable.\npattern matching with a case expression: This is one of the coolest things that I learned, and something similar is coming to Python v 3.10.\n\nYou can have nested patterns\nYou can pattern match against function arguments which allow for really nice syntax for achieving multiple dispatch type of functionality.. (not sure about python)\nYou can pattern match against types as well as data structures.\nYou can have constants in there as well.\n\ncase name \n     NameType name =&gt; ...\n   | (first, \"MyLastName\") =&gt; ...\n   | (first, last) =&gt; ...\n   | name =&gt; ...\n   | _ =&gt; ...\nTail recursion with accumulators. Ex- factorial\nThe fn keyword is used to define anonymous functions.\nML uses lexical scope which means function is evaluated in the environment where the function was defined. dynamic scope, which is usually not desired, is the alternative where the function is evaluated in the in the environment it is called.\nClosure - the call stack has a “pair” that is the (function, environment when the function was defined). This pair is called the closure. The call stack has a snapshot of what the environment looked like at the time the function was defined.\nfold is like reduce.\nML supports function composition like this with the keyword o: f1 o f2 o f3\n\nbest to do a val binding to avoid unnecessary wrapping: val newfunc = f1 o f2\nwith o you apply functions from right to left so f1 o f2 x is the same as f1(f2(x)) there is an alternative that is left to right called the pipeline operator.\n\nCurrying and partial application\n\nUniversal way to make a func curryable: ml       fun myfunc x           let fun f2 (z) = z               fun f1 (y) = f2(y)           begin               f1           end\nML has first class support for currying so you don’t have to do the above hack.\n\nML supports mutual recursion just like let-rec in racket.",

    "text": "Racket (Part B)\nRacket is related to Lisp and Scheme. Everything is a function. Parenthesis for everything. The position of parenthesis changes the meaning of the code.\n\nRacket has dynamic typing, unlike SML.\nThunks: Wrap a function in a zero argument function to delay evaluation. Applications:\n\nStreams: the function will return a tuple of (value, func), and when you call func it will return (value, func) so you get one value at a time. This is not specific to Racket.\nLazy evaluation: You can use thunks to delay execution like a promise to a later time. This is an example of lazy evalution that doesn’t actually evaluate anything until being forced to:\n\n\n(define (my-delay f) (mcons #f f))\n\n(define (my-force th)\n\n(if (mcar th) (mcdr th) (begin (set-mcar! th #t) (set-mcdr! th ((mcdr th))) (mcdr th))))\nRacket allows you use macros that will evaluate before the code is run and that will “expand” into valid racket syntax.\nYou implemented your own small programming language. This used recursive calls to evluate expressions with the base case being the values (Integer, strings, etc). - Interperter: write a program in another language A that takes programs in B and produces answers directly. A better term would be “evaluator”. - Compiler: write program in another language A that takes programs in B and produces an equivalent program in langauage C. A better term here would be “translator”.\nClosures: for lexical scope, the interpreter has a stack of tuples. The tuples are (1) the function to be called (2) the environment, which contains the value of all variables at the time the function was defined. You also have to track the arguments for the function seperately, so you can evaluate the arguments in the environment the function was run in.",

    "text": "Ruby (Part C)\nI didn’t spend too much time some concepts I was mostly familiar with this.\n\nRuby is OOP, dynamically typed.\nRuby is pure OOP, even top level functions and variables are part of the built-in Object class.\nThey have fastcore like shortcuts for getters and setters:\n\nattr_reader :y, :z # defines getters \nattr_accessor :x # defines getters and setters\nnewlines are important. The syntax can change without them.\nDynamic class definitions. The following code will result in Class with the methods foo and bar! The second one doesn’t override the first one!\nclass Class\n    def foo\n        ...\n    end\nend\n\nclass Class\n    def bar\n        ...\n    end\nend\n\nBlocks\nThey also have a very convenient lambda like thing called Blocks:\nsum = 0 \n[4,6,8].each { |x| sum += x \n               puts sum }\nYou can use Blocks to make accumulators too, and even use inject to initialize the accumulator:\nsum = [4,6,8].inject(0) { |acc,elt| acc + elt }\nTo use blocks in a method, you will have to look that up in the docs. This involves the yield keyword. For example, this code will print “hi” 3 times:\ndef foo x \n  if x \n    yield \n   else \n    yield \n    yield \n   end \nend \n\nfoo (true) { puts \"hi\" } \nfoo (false) { puts \"hi\" }\nBlocks are not first class functions even though they kind of look like lambdas. Lets say you wanted to map over an array but wanted to return an array of functions instead of values. The way to do this is to use the keyword lambda:\nc = a.map {|x| {|y| x &gt;= y} } # wrong, a syntax error\n\nc = a.map {|x| lambda {|y| x &gt;= y} } # this will work\n\nSubclassing\n\nsuper calls the same method in the parent class. You dont have to do super.method_name(), just super.\nInstance variables are preceeded with @\n\nChild classes are defined like this:\nclass Child &lt; Parent\n ...\nend\n\n\n\nTyping\nThey discussed the various ways different type systems are constructed. The interface idiom, that is familar to you from Golang (but not specific to Golang) was introduced.",

You can’t automatically change from one kind of controller to another.\nA DaemonSet runs a control loop that will watch for any new nodes and start a pod on that node.\n\nUse cases for DaemonSets:\n\nWant to run a pod on every node\nyou have only a subset of nodes that can receive traffic from the internet -&gt; use labels to achieve this.\n\n\n\nLabeling A Node For DaemonSets\nThis allows you to select which nodes the Daemonset runs on:\n% cat pi/proxy/daemonset/nginx-ds-nodeSelector.yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: DaemonSet\nmetadata:\n  name: pi-proxy\n  labels:\n    kiamol: ch06\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: pi-proxy\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: pi-proxy\n    spec:\n...\n      nodeSelector:\n        kiamol: ch06\nTo use thie above yaml, you have to label your node like this:\nkl label node $(kl get nodes...) kiamol=ch06 --overwrite\n\n\nCascade Delete\nTLDR; you probably don’t need this\nYou can set cascade=False to delete a controller without deleting its managed objects. This is how you can change a controller but still keep pods alive.\nkl delete ds pi-proxy --cascade=orphan  # deletes the daemonset pi-proxy\nControllers use a label selector to find objects they manage, so you just have to make sure the new controller you define has the right label.

    "text": "Services\nkind: service\n\nYou can’t switch a Service from one type to another in every version of Kubernetes, so you’ll need to delete the original ClusterIP Service for the API before you can deploy the ExternalName Service.\n\nYou can\n\nDNS\nWhen you deploy a service, you can reference it from within the namespace by its name. For example, the following service:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: numbers-api\nspec:\n  ports:\n    - port: 80\n  selector:\n    app: numbers-api\n  type: ClusterIP # this isn't necessary, it's the default\nCan be referenced with just http://numbers-api – that is how it’s referenced in the application.\nIf the pod trying to reach that service is in a different namespace, you have to use the fully qualified name &lt;service-name&gt;.&lt;namespace&gt;, which would be http://numbers-api.default in this case.\n\nTesting DNS\nThe best way to test internal DNS problems is to use nslookup in a pod. You can deploy a pod specifically for network testing from the official k8s docs:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: dnsutils\n  namespace: default\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: dnsutils\n    image: registry.k8s.io/e2e-test-images/jessie-dnsutils:1.3\n    command:\n      - sleep\n      - \"infinity\"\n    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent\n  restartPolicy: Always\nYou can also reference the yaml like this kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/admin/dns/dnsutils.yaml\nLet’s say I’ve deployed a service called numbers-api in the default namespace:\n$ kl get svc\nNAME          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE\nnumbers-api   ClusterIP   10.98.154.232    &lt;none&gt;        80/TCP           13m\nYou can now test it with nslookup:\n# use nslookup &lt;service-name&gt; if the pod dnsutils ins int he same namespace as the service\nkubectl exec -i -t dnsutils -- nslookup numbers-api\n\n# or if your pod is in a different namespace than the service use &lt;service-name&gt;.&lt;namespace&gt;\nkubectl exec -i -t dnsutils -- nslookup numbers-api.default\nIf you are experiencing further issues, follow these debugging instructions\n\n\nLabels\nIf you have overlapping labels for a particular deployment, the service will route to all deployments that match that label. If you want to control for this, add additional unique labels. Just having one label like “myapp” can be dangerous for this reason.\nServices deal with networking. These use labels, too via a selector.\n\n\n\nRouting internal traffic ClusterIP\nClusterIP: default service that is internal DNS. type: ClusterIP\nForward port 8080 on your local computer to port 80 in container: kubectl port-forward deploy/numbers-web 8080:80\n\n\nRouting external traffic: LoadBalancer\ntype: LoadBalancer Uses labels too\n\n\nRouting Traffic Outside K8s ExternalNameService\ntype: ExternalName\nYou have to watch out when making HTTP requests through ENS, b/c the header wil still contain the original hostname, which will probably get rejected. It’s fine for things like TCP etc for databases.\n\n\nNamespaces\nThis is relevant to networking b/c resources outside the default namespace will have a different network address\nkubectl get svc -n default kubectl get svc -n kube-system\nFor example, the internal kube-dns service:\n kl get svc -n kube-system                                                                                                                                                                            (master)kiamol\nNAME       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                  AGE\nkube-dns   ClusterIP   10.96.0.10   &lt;none&gt;        53/UDP,53/TCP,9153/TCP   9d\nCan be accessed like this kl exec deploy/sleep-1 -- sh - c'nslookup kube-dns.kube-system.svc.cluster.local",

You could have also seen the yaml file for the other configmap we created earlier with kl get cm/sleep-config-env-file -o yaml and used that yaml file\nUse the config map in the deployment spec, and additionally mount a volume containing the config:\n% cat todo-list/todo-web-dev.yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: todo-web\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: todo-web\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: todo-web\n    spec:\n      containers:\n        - name: web\n          image: kiamol/ch04-todo-list\n          volumeMounts: # This will load the config json file into `/app/config` in your container\n            - name: config\n              mountPath: \"/app/config\" #directory path to mount the volume **BE CAREFUL** if you mounted this to `/app`, then it would have wiped out all the files!\n              readOnly: true\n      volumes: # volumes are defined at pod level\n        - name: config  # Name matches the volume mount\n          configMap: # volume source is the Config Map\n            name: todo-web-config-dev  #ConfigMap name\nBe careful when specifying the mount path, lots of people make mistakes here and overwrite existing data. K8s will not merge directories for you!\nIf you change the config map, it will refresh the files in the directory. You have to make sure your app is watching that directory though.\nInstead of loading the whole config map, you can selectively mount files in the config map like this:\n% cat todo-list/todo-web-dev-no-logging.yaml                                                                                                                                                                     \napiVersion: apps/v1\n...\n      volumes:\n        - name: config\n          configMap:\n            name: todo-web-config-dev\n            items:\n            - key: config.json\n              path: config.json",

[[service mesh]] uses patterns like this.\nFor example you may want to restrict what web requests or URLs your app is allowed to talk to. With an ambassador sidecar, you can block all traffic besides the allowed one. Here is an example:\n      containers:\n        - name: web\n          image: kiamol/ch03-numbers-web \n          env:\n          - name: http_proxy\n            value: http://localhost:1080\n          - name: RngApi__Url\n            value: http://localhost/api\n        - name: proxy                         # this is a basic proxy\n          image: kiamol/ch07-simple-proxy          \n          env:\n          - name: Proxy__Port                 #Routes network requets given \n            value: \"1080\"                     # the below mapping\n          - name: Proxy__Request__UriMap__Source\n            value: http://localhost/api\n          - name: Proxy__Request__UriMap__Target\n            value: http://numbers-api/sixeyed/kiamol/master/ch03/numbers/rng\nIn the above example, anything that is not in the mapping is blocked. Now the web app is restricted to a single address for outgoing requests, which are logged by the proxy.\nthe app container uses localhost addresses for any services it consumes, and it’s configured to route all network calls through the proxy container. The proxy is a custom app that logs network calls, maps localhost addresses to real addresses, and blocks any addresses that are not listed in the map. All that becomes functionality in the Pod, but it’s transparent to the application container.\nYou can also use Ambassador’s for database connections, to query read-only copies when there are no db updates/writes:",

You set a permissions in a role, and apply the role to one or more subject.\n\nGroup, Versions, Kinds and Resources\nA resource is described by the triple (group, version, kind) (GVK for short)\nSee this page\nIt is important to understand groups, versions, kinds, and resources for RBAC.\n\nKinds: each (group, version) contains one or more api types called Kinds. These are guaranteed to be compatible across versions\nResource: A use of Kind in the API. There is often a one-to-one mapping between Kinds and Resources. For instance, the pods resource corresponds to the Pod Kind. You can see the correspondence with the command kl api-resources --sort-by name.\n\nHowever the same Kind may be returned by multiple resources. For example, the Pod Kind is returned by the pods and pods/log resources Notice that resources are always lowercase, and by convention are the lowercase form of the Kind.\n\napiGroup: A collection of related functionality. Each group has one or more versions. This allows us to change how an API works over time. The api groups are referenced here.\n\nTo lookup the apiGroup for a resource, you can use the command kl api-resources --sort-by name, and ignoring the version name. For example, the pods resource is part of the core apiGroup which is the empty string in the spec (see below). You can also look at the reference docs, for example PriorityClass is part of the scheduling.k8s.io apiGroup, which is indicated here.\n\n\nExample of how to lookup the apiGroup and resource name for kind: PriorityClass:\n\n```bash\n$  kl api-resources --sort-by name\n\nNAME                              SHORTNAMES   APIVERSION                             NAMESPACED   KIND\n...\npriorityclasses                   pc           scheduling.k8s.io/v1                   false        PriorityClass\nThis tells us that the PriorityClass Kind is part of the scheduling.k8s.io apiGroup, and the resource name is priorityclasses.\n\n\nRole vs ClusterRole\nSome resources are namespaces, some are cluster wide.\n\nRole and RoleBinding work on namepsaced objects.\nClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding work on the whole cluster\n\nThere are lots of built in ClusterRoles which you can see with:\nkl get clusterrole",

    "title": "RBAC",
    "section": "Defining Roles",
    "text": "Defining Roles\nYou can define your own Role and ClusterRole objects. In addition to apiGroups andresources which we discussed above, you will also need to know about verbs.\nYou can see all the api request verbs here, which are: get, list, create, update, patch, watch, delete, and deletecollection.\nThe apiGroups referenced here is helpful to see the correspondence between the resource and the apiGroup. Below is an example Role and ClusterRole (which are not related):\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1 # this is the Group/Version used in the Binding\nkind: Role\nmetadata:\n  namespace: default\n  name: pod-reader\nrules:\n- apiGroups: [\"\"] # \"\" indicates the core API group\n  resources: [\"pods\"] #pods are part of the Core: \n  verbs: [\"get\", \"watch\", \"list\"]\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: ClusterRole\nmetadata:\n  # \"namespace\" omitted since ClusterRoles are not namespaced\n  name: secret-reader\nrules:\n- apiGroups: [\"\"] # secrets are part of Core https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.26/#secret-v1-core\n  resources: [\"secrets\"] # The name of the resource for accessing Secret objects is \"secrets\"\n  verbs: [\"get\", \"watch\", \"list\"]\n\nRoleBinding\nBelow is an example of a RoleBinding that grants the pod-reader role to the user jane in the namespace default. As a reminder, a RoleBinding assigns subjects to a Role, and a Role defines permissions. Thats why the below example doesn’t define any permissions. That is the associated Role’s job.\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\n# This role binding allows \"jane\" to read pods in the \"default\" namespace.\n# You need to already have a Role named \"pod-reader\" in that namespace.\nkind: RoleBinding\nmetadata:\n  name: read-pods\n  namespace: default\nsubjects:\n# You can specify more than one \"subject\"\n- kind: User\n  name: jane # \"name\" is case sensitive\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\nroleRef:\n  # \"roleRef\" specifies the binding to a Role / ClusterRole\n  kind: Role #this must be Role or ClusterRole\n  name: pod-reader # this must match the name of the Role or ClusterRole you wish to bind to\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\nA RoleBinding can also reference a ClusterRole to grant the permissions defined in that ClusterRole to resources inside the RoleBinding’s namespace. This kind of reference lets you define a set of common roles across your cluster, then reuse them within multiple namespaces which we saw above with RoleBinding to a ClusterRole.\n\nRoleBindings w/ existing ClusterRoles\nAn easy path is to use an existing built in ClusterRole and assign it to a subject. For example, we can assign the view role to a specific user:\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: RoleBinding\nmetadata:\n name: reader-view\n namespace: default                    # The scope of the binding\nsubjects:\n- kind: User\n  name: reader@kiamol.net               # The subject is the new user\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io   # The version of the K8s API used to specify the subject\nroleRef:\n kind: ClusterRole\n name: view                      # Gives them the view role from the built-in ClusterRole\n apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io   # The version of the K8s API used to specify the roleRef\nBy RoleBinding to an existing ClusterRole, you dont have to bother with creating a Role! Its a nice shortcut when you can get away with it.\nSeveral important notes:\n\nWe have to assign the RoleBinding to a namespace, because RoleBinding is scoped to a namespace, even though we are referencing an existing ClusterRole. Yes, you can create a RoleBinding to a ClusterRole you aren’t limited to only a Role!\n\nThe apiGroup is the version of the K8s api you are using to specify that object. For practical purposes, just accept the value rbac.authorization.k8s.io as boilerplate. Also if you leave this out, defaults values will probably be just fine.\n\nFrom the docs: APIGroup holds the API group of the referenced subject. Defaults to “” for ServiceAccount subjects. Defaults to “rbac.authorization.k8s.io” for User and Group subjects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must have a RoleBinding\n\n\n\nRoles are additive or grant-only (you can’t deny permissions). This means hat everything starts with no permissions and you must add them. What this also means that if you create a Role (in this case the reader-view) but no RoleBinding then your subject will have no permissions to do anything!\n\n\nAnother example of a RoleBinding to a ClusterRole:\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\n# This role binding allows \"dave\" to read secrets in the \"development\" namespace.\n# You need to already have a ClusterRole named \"secret-reader\".\nkind: RoleBinding\nmetadata:\n  name: read-secrets\n  #\n  # The namespace of the RoleBinding determines where the permissions are granted.\n  # This only grants permissions within the \"development\" namespace.\n  namespace: development\nsubjects:\n- kind: User\n  name: dave # Name is case sensitive\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\nroleRef:\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: secret-reader\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n\n\n\nClusterRoleBinding\nTo grant permissions across a whole cluster, you can use a ClusterRoleBinding. The following ClusterRoleBinding allows any user in the group “manager” to read secrets in any namespace.\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\n# This cluster role binding allows anyone in the \"manager\" group to read secrets in any namespace.\nkind: ClusterRoleBinding\nmetadata:\n  name: read-secrets-global\nsubjects:\n- kind: Group\n  name: manager # Name is case sensitive\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\nroleRef:\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: secret-reader\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nAfter you create a binding, you cannot change the Role or ClusterRole that it refers to. If you try to change a binding’s roleRef, you get a validation error. If you do want to change the roleRef for a binding, you need to remove the binding object and create a replacement.\n\n\n\n\nA More complex example\nBelow is an example of a custom Role with a RoleBinding:\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Role\nmetadata:\n name: system-pod-reader\n namespace: kube-system        # Scoped to the system namespace\nrules:\n- apiGroups: [\"\"]               # The API group of the object spec\n resources: [\"pods\"]           # Pods are in the core group, which\n verbs: [\"get\", \"list\"]        # is identified with an empty string.\n---\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: RoleBinding\nmetadata:\n name: kube-explorer-system\n namespace: kube-system         # Needs to match the role\nsubjects:\n- kind: ServiceAccount\n  name: kube-explorer            # The subject can be in a\n  namespace: default             # different namespace.\nroleRef:\n apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n kind: Role\n name: system-pod-reader",

Instead, you should create a dedicated service account per app.\nYou can see service accounts like this:\n#create a namespace, which also creates a new service account\n$ kl create ns foobar\n\n# see the service accounts in the namespace. one of the service accounts will be named \"default\"\n$ kl get serviceaccounts -n foobar                                                                                                              \nNAME      SECRETS   AGE\ndefault   0         10m\n\n\nCreating Your Own Service Accounts\nkubectl apply -f - &lt;&lt;EOF\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: build-robot\nEOF\nRemember that unless otherwise specified, every Pod runs as the default service account in its namespace. This means by default, Pods cannot access the Kubernetes API. You can change this by specifying a service account in the Pod spec that has the correct permissions.\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ServiceAccount\nmetadata:\n  name: build-robot\nautomountServiceAccountToken: false\n...\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: my-pod\nspec:\n  serviceAccountName: build-robot\n  automountServiceAccountToken: false\n...\nSetting automountServiceAccountToken to false will prevent the service account token from being mounted into the Pod. Otherwise, this is mounted at /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token. This setting in the Pod spec takes precedence over the setting in the ServiceAccount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou have to update or create a role binding to assign this build-robot service account to a particular role for it to be usable.",

To prevent one Pod from monopolizing all available resources, you should set resource limits for Pods. You should set both a memory limit and a CPU limit. If a Pod uses more than its resource limit, it is restarted (new container). If it continues to fail, it goes into a CrashLoopBackoff just like with liveness probes.\nYou can specify resource limits in the spec.containers[].resources.limits section of a Pod configuration. The following example sets a memory limit of 50 MiB for a container:\n\n\nvmemory-allocator-with-limit.yaml\n\nspec:                       # The Pod spec in the Deployment\n containers:\n   - image: kiamol/ch12-memory-allocator\n     resources:\n       limits:             # Resource limits constrain compute power\n         memory: 50Mi      # for the container; this limits RAM to 50 MB.\n\nWhen you create this Pod, the container is automatically assigned a memory limit of 256 MiB.

This may not be that important in the large scheme as in the cloud you have toosl that help with this.\n\n\nFluent Bit is a lightweight version of FluentD. It uses a DaemonSet to run a pod on each node, which uses a HostPath volume mount to access the log files.\nIt reads the log files from the node and sends them to Elasticsearch. It can also parse the logs and add metadata to them.

It doesn’t matter that its running in a different namespace because it is reading from each node so it doesn’t matter.\nThere are different pieces you can configure with FluentD\n\nWe’re currently running a simple configuration with three stages:\n\nthe input stage reads log files\nthe parser stage deconstructs the JSON log entries,\nand the output stage writes each log as a separate line to the standard output stream in the Fluent Bit container.\n\nBelow is part of a Fluent Bit configuration file:\nkind: ConfigMap\n...\n[INPUT]\n   Name              tail         # Reads from the end of a file\n   Tag               kube.*       # Uses a prefix for the tag\n   Path              /var/log/containers/timecheck*.log\n   Parser            docker       # Parses the JSON container logs\n   Refresh_Interval  10        # Sets the frequency to check the file list\n\n[OUTPUT]\n   Name            stdout         # Writes to standard out\n   Format          json_lines     # Formats each log as a line\n   Match           kube.*         # Writes logs with a kube tag prefix\nFluent Bit uses tags to identify the source of a log entry. The tag is added at the input stage and can be used to route logs to other stages. In this configuration, the log file name is used as the tag, prefixed with kube. The match rule routes all the kube tagged entries to the output stage so every log is printed out, but the input stage reads only the timecheck log files, so those are the only log entries you see.\nWhen you apply the configuration (revisit this chapter to see all the details), you can see the logs in the Fluent Bit container:\nkubectl logs  -l app=fluent-bit -n kiamol-ch13-logging --tail 2\nThis will show you logs from all namespaces, as fluentd is reading the logs from all nodes.\n\nRouting Output\nIf you look at the file fluentbit/update/fluentbit-config-match.yaml you will see a boilerplate config that is generic that will work with any cluster. (You just have to change the namespace and labels). You end up with tag that is kube.&lt;namespace_name&gt;.&lt;container_name&gt;.&lt;pod_name&gt;.&lt;docker_id&gt;- and then the log file name. Based on this, you can route output like so:\n```(.yml file=“fluentbit/update/fluentbit-config-match-multiple.yaml”) [OUTPUT] Name stdout # The standard out plugin will Format json_lines # print only log entries where Match kube.kiamol-ch13-test.* # the namespace is test.\n[OUTPUT] Name counter # The counter prints a count of Match kube.kiamol-ch13-dev.* # logs from the dev namespace.\n\nThis shows you that you can have different kinds of logs for different namespaces, for example the `dev` namespace is counting the lines of logs.  The counter is a plugin that is built into FluentD.\n\n### Elasticsearch\n\nElasticsearch is a database, where each datum can have different fields, there is no fixed schema.  You access it via a REST API.  Kibana is a web interface for Elasticsearch. Fluent Bit has an Elasticsearch output plugin that creates a document for each log entry using the Elasticsearch REST API. The plugin needs to be configured with the domain name of the Elasticsearch server, and you can optionally specify the index where documents should be created.  Note that if there are logs that don't match an output rule, they will be discarded:\n\n```{.yml filename=\"fluentbit-config-elasticsearch.yaml\"}\n[OUTPUT]\n   Name       es                            # Logs from the test namespace\n   Match      kube.kiamol-ch13-test.*       # are routed to Elasticsearch\n   Host       elasticsearch                 # and created as documents in \n   Index      test                          # the \"test\" index.\n\n[OUTPUT]\n   Name       es                            # System logs are created in\n   Match      kube.kube-system.*            # the \"sys\" index in the same\n   Host       elasticsearch                 # Elasticsearch server.\n   Index      sys\nWe deploy Elasticsearch and Kibana and get the endpoint of Kibana.\nI skipped the rest of this b/c I’m hoping cloud services provide a good logging stack for me. Also, you will likely want to use plugins for FluentD.",

We highly recommend this route unless you have specific needs that are not addressed by running in a container.\n\n\nTIP: This is also the easiest way to get TensorFlow Serving working with GPU support.\n\nIt worth looking at The Dockerfile for TFServing:\nENV MODEL_BASE_PATH=/models\nRUN mkdir -p ${MODEL_BASE_PATH}\n\n# The only required piece is the model name in order to differentiate endpoints\nENV MODEL_NAME=model\n\n\nRUN echo '#!/bin/bash \\n\\n\\\ntensorflow_model_server --port=8500 --rest_api_port=8501 \\\n--model_name=${MODEL_NAME} --model_base_path=${MODEL_BASE_PATH}/${MODEL_NAME} \\\n\"$@\"' &gt; /usr/bin/tf_serving_entrypoint.sh \\\n&& chmod +x /usr/bin/tf_serving_entrypoint.sh\n\nthis means that it is looking in /models/model by default.

However, you can change that with a model server config. You can also serve multiple versions of a model, add labels to models, etc. This is probably one of the most useful aspects of TF Serving. Here are some configs that allow you to serve multiple versions at the same time:\n\n%%writefile ./model/models.config\n\n\nmodel_config_list {\n config {\n    name: 'model'\n    base_path: '/models/model/'\n    model_platform: 'tensorflow'\n    model_version_policy: {all: {}}\n        }\n}\n\nOverwriting ./model/models.config\n\n\nIf you wanted to specify specific models to serve, you could name the versions instead of specifying all like this:\n\n%%writefile ./model/models-specific.config\n\nmodel_config_list {\n config {\n    name: 'model'\n    base_path: '/models/model/'\n    model_platform: 'tensorflow'\n    model_version_policy {\n      specific {\n        versions: 1\n        versions: 2\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nOverwriting ./model/models-specific.config\n\n\nTo read the config files, we need to pass these additional flags when running the container:\ndocker run \\\n--mount type=bind,source=/home/hamel/hamel/notes/serving/tfserving/model,target=/models/model \\\n--net=host \\\n-t tensorflow/serving \\\n--model_config_file=/models/model/models-specific.config \\\n--model_config_file_poll_wait_seconds=60 \nThe flag --model_config_file_poll_wait_seconds=60 tells the server to check for a new config file at the path every 60 seconds. This is optional but likely a good idea so you can change your config file without rebooting the server.\nTo access a specific version of the model, you would make a request to\nhttp://host:port/v1/models/${MODEL_NAME}[/versions/${VERSION}|/labels/${LABEL}]:predict. For example, for version 1 the endpoint would be http://localhost:8501/v1/models/model/versions/1:predict.\nIf you did not care about the version, and just wanted the highest version we can use the general endpoint without the version which will serve the highest version by default:\nhttp://localhost:8501/v1/models/model:predict\nWe can test that all of these version is avialable to serve like so:\n\n! curl http://localhost:8501/v1/models/model/versions/2\n\n{\n \"model_version_status\": [\n  {\n   \"version\": \"2\",\n   \"state\": \"AVAILABLE\",\n   \"status\": {\n    \"error_code\": \"OK\",\n    \"error_message\": \"\"\n   }\n  }\n ]\n}\n\n\n\n! curl http://localhost:8501/v1/models/model/versions/1\n\n{\n \"model_version_status\": [\n  {\n   \"version\": \"1\",\n   \"state\": \"AVAILABLE\",\n   \"status\": {\n    \"error_code\": \"OK\",\n    \"error_message\": \"\"\n   }\n  }\n ]\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nTF Serving doesn’t make all versions available by default, only the latest one (with the highest number). You have to supply a config file if you want multiple versions to be made available at once. You probably should use labels to make URLs consistent in production scenarios.",

    "text": "Summary\nBelow is a summary of my findings:\n\n🏁 mlc is the fastest. This is so fast that I’m skeptical and am now motivated to measure quality (if I have time). When checking the outputs manually, they didn’t seem that different than other approaches.\n❤️ CTranslate2 is my favorite tool, which is among the fastest but is also the easiest to use. The documentation is the best out of all of the solutions I tried. Furthermore, I think that the ergonomics are excellent for the models that they support. Unlike vLLM, CTranslate doesn’t seem to support distributed inference just yet.\n🛠️ vLLM is really fast, but CTranslate can be much faster. On other hand, vLLM supports distributed inference, which is something you will need for larger models. vLLM might be the sweet spot for serving very large models.\n😐 Text Generation Inference is an ok option (but nowhere near as fast as vLLM) if you want to deploy HuggingFace LLMs in a standard way. TGI has some nice features like telemetry baked in (via OpenTelemetry) and integration with the HF ecosystem like inference endpoints. One thing to note that as of 7/28/2023, the license for TGI was changed to be more restrictive that may interfere with certain commercial uses. I am personally not a fan of the license.\n\n\nRough Benchmarks\nThis study focuses on various approaches to optimizing latency. Specifically, I want to know which tools are the most effective at optimizing latency for open source LLMs. In order to focus on latency, I hold the following variables constant:\n\nbatch size of n = 1 for all prediction requests (holding throughput constant).1\n\nAll experiments were conducted on a Nvidia A6000 GPU, unless otherwise noted.\nMax output tokens were always set to 200.\nAll numbers are calculated as an average over a fixed set of 9 prompts.\nThe model used is meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf on the HuggingFace Hub 2.\n\nIn addition to batch size of n = 1 and using a A6000 GPU (unless noted otherwise), I also made sure I warmed up the model by sending an initial inference request before measuring latency.\n\nLlama-v2-7b benchmark: batch size = 1, max output tokens = 200\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\navg tok/sec\navg time (seconds)\navg output token count\n\n\nplatform\noptions\ngpu\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCTranslate2\nfloat16 quantization\nA6000\n44.8\n4.5\n200.0\n\n\nint8 quantization\nA6000\n62.6\n3.2\n200.0\n\n\nHF Hosted Inference Endpoint\n-\nA10G\n30.4\n6.6\n202.0\n\n\nHuggingFace Transformers (no server)\n-\nA6000\n24.6\n7.5\n181.4\n\n\nnf4 4bit quantization bitsandbytes\nA6000\n24.3\n7.6\n181.4\n\n\nTGI\n-\nA6000\n21.1\n9.5\n200.0\n\n\nquantized w/ GPTQ\nA6000\n23.6\n8.8\n200.0\n\n\nquantized w/ bitsandbytes\nA6000\n1.9\n103.0\n200.0\n\n\nmlc\nq4f16\nA6000\n117.1\n1.3\n153.9\n\n\ntext-generation-webui\nexllama\nA6000\n77.0\n1.7\n134.0\n\n\nvllm\n-\nA100 (on Modal Labs)\n41.5\n3.4\n143.1\n\n\nA6000\n46.4\n3.8\n178.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn some cases I did not use an A6000 b/c the platform didn’t have that particular GPU available. You can ignore these rows if you like, but I still think it is valuable information. I had access to a A6000, so I just used what I had.\nI noticed that the output of the LLM was quite different (less tokens) when using vLLM. I am not sure if I did something wrong here, or it changes the behavior of the LLM.\nFurthermore, the goal was not to be super precise on these benchmarks but rather to get a general sense of how things work and how they might compare to each other out of the box. Some of the tools above are inference servers which perform logging, tracing etc. in addition to optimizing models which effect latency. The idea is to see where there are significant differences between tools. I discussed this more here.",

There are two categories of tools for model inference:\n\nInference servers: these help with providing a web server that can provide a REST/grpc or other interface to interact with your model as a service. These inference servers usually have parameters to help you make trade-offs between throughput and latency. Additionally, some inference servers come with additional features like telemetry, model versioning and more. You can learn more about this topic the serving section of these notes. For LLMs, popular inference servers are the Text Generation Inference (TGI) and vLLM.\nModel Optimization: These modify your model to make them faster for inference. Examples include quantization, Paged Attention, Exllama and more.\n\nIt is common to use both Inference servers and Model Optimization techniques in conjunction. Some inference servers like TGIand vLLM even help you apply optimization techniques.3",

Be careful when using TGI in commercial applications.\n\n\nText generation inference which is often referred to as “TGI” was easy to use without any optimization. You can run it like this:\n\n\n“start_server.sh”\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [ -z \"$HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN\" ]\nthen\n  echo \"HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN is not set. Please set it before running this script.\"\n  exit 1\nfi\n\nmodel=\"TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GPTQ\"\nvolume=$PWD/data\n\ndocker run --gpus all \\\n -e HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN=$HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN \\\n -e GPTQ_BITS=4 -e GPTQ_GROUPSIZE=128 \\\n --shm-size 5g -p 8081:80 \\\n -v $volume:/data ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference \\\n --max-best-of 1 \"$@\"\n\nWe can then run the server with this command:\nbash start_server.sh --model-id \"meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp\n\n\n\nYou can see all the options for the TGI container with the help flag like so:\ndocker run ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference --help | less\n\n\n\nQuantization\nQuantization was very difficult to get working. There is a —quantize flag with accepts bitsandbytes and gptq. The bitsandbytes approach makes inference much slower, which others have reported.\nTo make gptq work for llama v2 models requires a bunch of work, you have to install the text-generation-server which can take a while and is very brittle to get right. I had to step through the Makefile carefully. After that you have to download the weights with:\ntext-generation-server download-weights meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf\nYou can run the following command to perform the quantization (the last argument is the destination directory where the weights are stored).\ntext-generation-server quantize \"meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf\" data/quantized/\nHowever, this step is not needed for the most popular models, as someone will likely already have quantized and uploaded them to the Hub.\n\nPre-Quantized Models\nAlternatively, you can use a pre-quantized model that has been uploaded to the Hub. TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GPTQ is a good example of one. To get this to work, you have to be careful to set the GPTQ_BITS and GPTQ_GROUPSIZE environment variables to match the config. For example This config necessitates setting GPTQ_BITS=4 and GPTQ_GROUPSIZE=128 These are already set in start_server.sh shown above. This PR will eventually fix that.\nTo use the TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GPTQ with TGI, I can use the same bash script with the following arguments:\nbash start_server.sh --model-id TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GPTQ --quantize gptq\n\n\n\nComparison Without TGI Server\nWhen I first drafted this study I got the following response on twitter:\n\n\nBased on your code (https://t.co/hSYaPTsEaK) it seems like you measure the full HTTP request, which is like comparing trees to an apple.\n\n— Philipp Schmid (@_philschmid) July 29, 2023\n\n\nPhillip certainly has a point! I am indeed testing both! I’m looking for big differences in tools here, and since some inference servers have optimization tools, and some optimization tools do not have an inference server I cannot do a true apples to apples comparison. However, I think its still useful to try different things as advertised to see what is possible, and also take note of really significant gaps in latency between tools.\nTherefore, I ran the following tests to perform the similar optimizations as TGI, but without the server to see what happened:\n\nHuggingFace Transformers\nI was able to get slightly better performance without the TGI server as predicted by Phillip, but it did not account for the the massive gap between some tools (which is exactly the kind of thing I was looking for).\nTo benchmark quantization with bitsandbytes, I followed this blog post and wrote this benchmarking code. I quantized the model by loading it like this:\nmodel_id = \"meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf\"\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)\nnf4_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(\n   load_in_4bit=True,\n   bnb_4bit_quant_type=\"nf4\",\n   bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16\n)\nmodel_nf4 = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, quantization_config=nf4_config)\nUnlike TGI, I was able to get bitsandbytes to work properly here, but just like TGI it didn’t speed anything up for me with respect to inference latency. As reflected in the benchmark table, I got nearly the same results with transformers without any optimizations.\n\n\nGPTQ\nI also quantized the model using AutoGPTQ without an inference server to compare against TGI. The code for that is here.\nThe results were so bad ~ 5 tok/sec that I decided not to put this in the table, because it seemed quite off to me.",

    "text": "Text Generation WebUI\nAman let me know about text-generation-web-ui, and also these instructions for quickly experimenting with ExLlama and ggml. I wasn’t able to get the ggml variant to work properly, unfortunately. If you are really serious about using exllama, I recommend trying to use it without the text generation UI and look at the exllama repo, specifically at test_benchmark_inference.py. (I didn’t have time for this, but if I was going to use exllama for anything serious I would go this route).\nFrom the root of the text-generation-web-ui repo, you can run the following commands to start an inference server optimized with ExLlama:\npython3 download-model.py TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GPTQ\npython3 server.py --listen --extensions openai --loader exllama_hf --model TheBloke_Llama-2-7B-GPTQ\nAfter the server was started, I used this code to conduct the benchmark.\nOverall, I didn’t like this particular piece of software much. It’s bit bloated because its trying to do too many things at once (An inference server, Web UIs, and other optimizations). That being said, the documentation is good and it is easy to use.\nI don’t think there is any particular reason to use this unless you want an end-to-end solution that also comes with a web user-interface (which many people want!).",

Surprisingly, I had much lower latency when running on a local A6000 vs. a hosted A100 on Modal Labs. It’s possible that I did something wrong here. Currently, vLLM is the fastest solution for when you need distributed inference (i.e. when your model doesn’t fit on a single GPU)..\nvLLM offers a server, but I benchmarked the model locally using their tools instead.

There is also a python client.\nTheir documentation says they are using TGI under the hood. However, my latency was significantly faster on their hosted inference platform than using TGI locally. This could be due to the fact that I used a A10G with them but only a A6000 locally. It’s worth looking into why this discrepancy exists further.\nThe code for this benchmark can be found here.",

    "text": "Background\n\nMasking Inputs\nOne of the most popular features of axolotl is setting the following configuration value:\n\n\nconfig.yml\n\ntrain_on_inputs: false\n\nIf you declare a dataset format such as alpaca or chatml, axolotl knows what is an input (i.e. human) vs. an output (i.e. the assistant) and masks the input labels so that your model can focus on predicting the outputs only.\n\n\nYou may not want prompt templates\nHowever, there are many situations where you don’t want to use one of these formats or templates (I usually don’t!). This is because they can:\n\nAdd unnecessary boilerplate to your prompts.\nCreate artifacts like special delimiters &lt;|im_start|&gt; that can quickly become footguns if you don’t include them correctly at inference time.\nEnforce a chat interface when you do not want one. Sometimes you just want to fine tune a model to a very specific task and do NOT want multi-turn conversations, roles, etc.\nLimit you to only certain roles that the template allows.\n\n\n\nThe input_output format\nYou can construct your prompts without a template by using the input_output format, by setting type: input_output in your configuration file like this:\n\n\nconfig.yml\n\ntrain_on_inputs: false # Mask segments of your data\ndatasets:\n  - path: output.jsonl\n    type: input_output  # use template free prompt construction\n\nUnlike type: completion, which is also template-free, type: input_output allows you to mask segments of your text.

    "text": "Usage\nThis is how you can use the input_output format:\n\n1. Prepare Data\nTo use the input_output format, collect your data in the following format into a jsonl file (below is the first row from the file output.jsonl pretty-printed):\n\n! head -n1 output.jsonl | python -m json.tool\n\n{\n    \"segments\": [\n        {\n            \"label\": true,\n            \"text\": \"&lt;s&gt;Hello\\n\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"label\": true,\n            \"text\": \"hi there!. \"\n        },\n        {\n            \"label\": false,\n            \"text\": \"goodbye \"\n        },\n        {\n            \"label\": true,\n            \"text\": \"farewell&lt;/s&gt;\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\nSet label:false when you want to mask a segment of text so that the model isn’t trained on it. Some things to keep in mind:\n\nEOS, BOS, spaces, newlines etc. are entirely up to you. Axolotl concatenates all the segments as-is. The tokenizer doesn’t add anything additional. Notice how I added spaces, newlines, &lt;s&gt; (BOS), and &lt;/s&gt; (EOS) myself.\nMake sure you check the materialized output to validate that the prompt is getting assembled how you like.\n\n\n\n3. Use type: input_output\nLet’s materialize data with our output.jsonl file by setting type: input_output in our axolotl config:\n\n%%writefile training_config.yaml\nbase_model: mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1\ndata_seed: 49\nseed: 49\n\ndatasets:\n  - path: output.jsonl\n    type: input_output \nval_set_size: 0.1\n\nsequence_len: 896\nsample_packing: false\n\nmicro_batch_size: 2\ngradient_accumulation_steps: 3\neval_batch_size: 2\nnum_epochs: 1\nlearning_rate: 0.0002\n\ntrain_on_inputs: false\nspecial_tokens:\n  bos_token: \"&lt;s&gt;\"\n  eos_token: \"&lt;/s&gt;\"\n  unk_token: \"&lt;unk&gt;\"\n\nOverwriting training_config.yaml\n\n\nYou can use the following command to materialize your data. The --debug flag will print the tokens, along with the labels so you can verify that the correct items are being ignored:\n\n! python -m axolotl.cli.preprocess training_config.yaml --debug\n\n\n[2024-03-05 23:36:41,948] [INFO] [real_accelerator.py:191:get_accelerator] Setting ds_accelerator to cuda (auto detect)\n\n                                 dP            dP   dP \n\n                                 88            88   88 \n\n      .d8888b. dP.  .dP .d8888b. 88 .d8888b. d8888P 88 \n\n      88'  `88  `8bd8'  88'  `88 88 88'  `88   88   88 \n\n      88.  .88  .d88b.  88.  .88 88 88.  .88   88   88 \n\n      `88888P8 dP'  `dP `88888P' dP `88888P'   dP   dP \n\n                                                       \n\n                                                       \n\n\n\n[2024-03-05 23:36:43,224] [INFO] [axolotl.normalize_config:178] [PID:607731] [RANK:0] GPU memory usage baseline: 0.000GB (+0.498GB misc)\n\n[2024-03-05 23:36:43,333] [WARNING] [axolotl.cli.preprocess.do_cli:54] [PID:607731] [RANK:0] preprocess CLI called without dataset_prepared_path set, using default path: last_run_prepared\n\n[2024-03-05 23:36:43,725] [DEBUG] [axolotl.load_tokenizer:245] [PID:607731] [RANK:0] EOS: 2 / &lt;/s&gt;\n\n[2024-03-05 23:36:43,725] [DEBUG] [axolotl.load_tokenizer:246] [PID:607731] [RANK:0] BOS: 1 / &lt;s&gt;\n\n[2024-03-05 23:36:43,725] [DEBUG] [axolotl.load_tokenizer:247] [PID:607731] [RANK:0] PAD: 2 / &lt;/s&gt;\n\n[2024-03-05 23:36:43,725] [DEBUG] [axolotl.load_tokenizer:248] [PID:607731] [RANK:0] UNK: 0 / &lt;unk&gt;\n\n[2024-03-05 23:36:43,725] [INFO] [axolotl.load_tokenizer:259] [PID:607731] [RANK:0] No Chat template selected.

    "section": "Training w/ LoRA",
    "text": "Training w/ LoRA\nThe key to estimating memory needed for training is to anchor off the # of trainable parameters. The general formula is:\n(Estimate from calculator in GB + ( # of trainable params in Billions * (dtype of trainable params / 8) * 4)) * 1.2\nHere is the rationale for each of the terms:\n\ndtype of trainable params refers to the dtype of your unfrozen model parameters for LoRA, which is usually a different precision than the rest of the frozen model. It’s common to load the rest of the model with 8-bit or 4-bit quantization and keep the LorA adapters at 16 or 32-bit precision. We divide this by 8 to get the number of bytes per parameter. For example, if there are 1B trainable parameters and they are 16-bit, this would add 1 * (16 / 8) = 2GB to the estimate, which you have to further multiply by other quantities (see below example).\nThe 4x is tied to the popular Adam optimizer (if you use a different one, YMMV). You need 2x for the optimizer, 1x for the model and 1x for the gradients.\nThe 1.2x is additional overhead for the forward pass while training the model. You can read more about this heuristic in this blog post from Eleuther AI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe 1 added to 20% is just a mathematical trick for increasing a quantity by a %. For example, if you want to increase a quantity by 20% you can multiply by 1.20. I only mention this because this term confused some people!\n\n\n\nExample\nFor example, if you are using Lora and 0.5B of your parameters are trainable and are fp16, and the calculator says you need 14GB of vRAM, this is how you would calculate the amount of total memory you need for training:\n(14GB + ( 0.5 * (16 / 8) * 4) ) * 1.2 =\n(14GB + 4) * 1.2 = 21.6\nAnswer: ~21.6 GB of vRAM",

Then after that the plugin that it’s trying to reach out to, which is kind of an unreliable third party service, might fail as well. And then presenting that to the user might have failed as well.”\n\nHis initial approach was to implement extensive print logging and store traces in MongoDB, creating additional endpoints to parse through the logs. While this provided some visibility, it became cumbersome to navigate and understand what was happening in the system.",

The key is getting all the necessary information in one place – whether that’s a database, traces, or other context – so you can quickly understand what’s happening in your system.\n\nSpecialized LLM Tooling\nRather than building logging infrastructure from scratch, we discussed several existing tools designed specifically for LLM applications. These include hosted solutions like Langsmith, Braintrust, Humanloop, as well as open source options like Phoenix Arize.\nThese platforms provide auto-instrumentation capabilities – they can automatically capture the entire trace of what happens in your LLM application, from the initial prompt to function calls and responses. As Sebastian noted, this would have been “a huge time saver” compared to building custom logging infrastructure.\nThe tools also provide facilities for prompt iteration. Sebastian mentioned how testing his agent would require running “from zero to the end,” leading to wasted time and money. With proper tooling, you can iterate on specific components using saved traces, making development more efficient.",

    "text": "When to Adopt Tools\nSebastian raised an important question: “When should I switch over to this tool as opposed to just building my own tooling?”\nWhile there’s no universal answer, the guidance I provided was to distinguish between different components:\n\nFor logging and observability infrastructure, use existing tools rather than building from scratch. This is because logging and observability are likely not your core product, and you want to spend your time wisely.\nFor data viewing interfaces, first see if using an excel spreadsheet or a jupyter notebook will fit your needs. If not, it is often advantageous to build your own data viewer to remove friction from looking at your data. The wisdom is your data and use case has idiosyncrasies that often will not be served by a generic tool. Furthermore, you can use front end frameworks like Gradio, Streamlit, or FastHTML to quickly build a data viewer without too much effort.",

    "text": "Using Error Analysis to Tame Complex Systems\nTowards the end of our conversation, we tackled the challenge of debugging and evaluating complex, interconnected systems. Since there are many possible failure points, the challenge he faced was where to focus his efforts.\nThis is exactly where a technique called error analysis shines. When you have multiple potential failure points - it’s tempting to try to build comprehensive evals for every possible failure mode. However, as Sebastian discovered with his initial logging approach, this can quickly become overwhelming.\nInstead, error analysis helps you identify which failures actually matter. The process is straightforward:\n\nLook at a representative set of examples (start with at least 50)1\nCategorize the types of failures you observe\nTrack which parts of your system are involved in each failure\n\nThis focused analysis often reveals surprising patterns. You might discover that while your system has many potential failure points, 80% of meaningful failures occur in just a few places. This approach is particularly valuable for interconnected systems because it reveals not just where failures occur, but how they cascade through your system. Understanding these patterns lets you focus your monitoring efforts where they matter most and prioritize fixes that will have the biggest impact. The goal isn’t to catch every possible error - it’s to understand and address the ones that meaningfully impact your system’s performance.\nYou can follow this bit about error analysis at this part of the video.",

You can make exceptions to the read only constraint with the -v flag:\n\n\n\nOverride the entrypoint using the --entrypoint flag (this is discussed in part 2 of the book).\n\n\n\nInjecting environment variables\nWith the --env or -e flags.\nA nice trick to see all the environment variables in a docker container is to use the Unix command env\n\nSetting multiple environment variables: use \\ for multiline like this:\ndocker create \\\n  --env WORDPRESS_DB_HOST=&lt;my database hostname&gt; \\\n  --env WORDPRESS_DB_USER=site_admin \\\n  --env WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=MeowMix42 \\ \nwordpress:4\n\n\nAutomatically restarting containers\nDocker uses an exponential backoff strategy - double the previous time waiting until restarting.\ndocker run -d --restart always ...\nSee these restart policies\n\nno\non-failure[:max-retries]\nalways\nunless-stopped\n\n\n\nRemoving containers vs. images\nContainers are the actual instantiation of an image, just like how an object is an instantion of an instance of a class.\ndocker rm: remove a container docker rmi: remove an image\n\n\n\nChapter 3\n\nTwo ways to publish an image\n\nBuild locally, push image to registry\nMake a Dockerfile and use DockerHub’s build system. This is preferred and considered to be safer, and DockerHub will mark your image as trusted if you do this because it is the only way to provide transparency to what is in your image.\n\nSearch dockerhub by keyword , sorted descending by stars\n\ndocker search &lt;keyword&gt;\nexample: docker search postgres\n\nUsing Alternative registries\n\ndocker pull quay.io/dockerinaction/ch3_hello_registry:latest\n\n\n\nImages as files\nYou can transport, save and load images as files! (You don’t have to push them to a registry).\n\nYou can then load the image:\ndocker load -i myfile.tar\n\n\n\nChapter 4 Persistent Storage &. Shared State with Volumes\n-v and --volume are aliases\n--volumes-from=\"&lt;container-name&gt;\" Mount all volumes from the given container\n\nDifferent kind of Volumes\n\nBind mount - this is what you always use\nDocker managed volume (2 kinds)\n\nAnonymous\nNamed volume (a special case of Anonymous)\n\n\nUse volumes | Docker Documentation - Named vs. Anonymous volumes: article - Hamel: maybe? You might use named volumes to persist data between containers.\n\n\nTo persist data with named volumes\nNamed volume is a kind of anonymous volume where the mount point is managed by Docker. Example of how you used a named volume:\n\nStart container with a named volume: docker run --name myDatabaseWithVolume -v appdata:/var/lib/mysql  mysql save a table in the mysql database\nStart a new container with the same named volume docker run --name myDatabaseWithVolume2 -v appdata:/var/lib/mysql mysql You should be able to see the same table you created in the last container b/c data has been persisted.\n\n\n\nSee where Docker anonymous volumes store information\nUnlike a bind mount, where you explicitly name the host location, docker will manage the storage location of anonymous volumes. But how do you know where the files are stored on the host?\nYou can use docker inspect command filtered for the Volumes key to find the storage location on the host.\nCreate a container with an anonymous volume. docker run -v /some/location --name cass-shared alpine\ndocker inspect -f \"{{json .Volumes}}\" cass-shared\nThis will output a json blob which will show the mount points.\n\n\nOther things you didn’t know about volumes\n\nwhen you mount a volume, it overrides any files already at that location\n\nYou can mount specific files which avoid this\nif you specify a host directory that doesn’t exist Docker will create it for you\n\nexception: If you are mounting a file instead of a directory and it doesn’t exist on the host, Docker will throw an error\n\n\nyou can mount a volume as read only -v /source:/destination:ro\n\nsee docs (there is this optional third argument for volumes)\n\n\n\n\nThe volumes-from flag\nAllows you to share volumes with another container. When you use this flag, the same volumes are mounted into your container at the same location.\n\nVolumes are copied transitively, so this will automatically mount volumes that are also mounted this way from another container.\nCaveats - You cannot mount a shared volume to a different location within a container. This is a limitation of --volumes-from - If you have a collision in the destination mount point among several volumes-from only one volume will survive, which you can ascertain from docker inpsect - see above for how to use docker inspect - You cannot change the write permission of the volume, you inherit whatever the permission is in the source container.\n\n\nCleaning up volumes\n-v flag\ndocker rm -v will delete any managed volumes referenced by the target container\nHowever, if you delete all containers but forget a -v flag you will be left with an orphaned volume. This is bad b/c it takes up disk space until cleaned up. You have to run complicated cleanup steps to get rid of orphans.\nSolution: There is none, its a good habit to use -v anytime you call docker rm\nHamel: this means that- - Don’t use managed volumes unless you really need it - If you do use them, try to include makefiles that include -v as a part of things\n\n\nAdvanced Volume Stuff\n\nYou can have a volume container p. 72 so that you can reference --volume-from from all your containers.\n\nData-paced volume containers, you can pre-load volume containers with data p. 73\nYou can change the behavior of currently running containers by mounting configuration files and application in volumes. In a way, Hamel\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5 Single Host Networking\n\nTerminology:\n\nprotocols: tcp, http\ninterfaces: IP addresses\nports: you know what this means\n\nCustomary ports:\n\nHTTP: 80\nMySQL: 3306\nMemcached: 11211\n\n\n\n\nDiscuss advanced networking and creating a network using the docker network command. Hamel: I don’t see an immediate use for this.\n\nSpecial container networks:\n\nhost\n\ndocker run --network host allows you to pretend like the host is your local machine, and you can expose any port and that will bind to the host.\n\nnone\n\ndocker run --network none closes all connection to the outside world. This is useful for security.\n\n\n\n\nexposing ports\n-p 8080 This binds port 8080 to a random port on the host! you can find the port that the container is bound to by docker port &lt;image name&gt; example: docker run -p 8080 --name listener alpine docker port listener\nThis will give you output that looks like container --&gt; host (which is reverse the other nomenclature of host:container\n-p 8080:8080 this binds the container’s port to the host’s port 8080\n-p 0.0.0.0:8080:8080/tcp same as above but specifies the interface and the tcp protocol.\nSyntax is -p &lt;host-interface&gt;:&lt;host-port&gt;:&lt;target-port&gt;/&lt;protocol&gt;\n\n\n\nChapter 6 Isolation\n\nLimit resources: Memory, CPU,\n\n-m or --memory\n\nnumber, where unit = b, k, m or g\nmemory limits are not reservations, just caps\n\n--cpu-shares\n\nis a weight you set that is used to calculate % of CPU usage allowed\n% is calculated as weight / (sum of all weights)\nonly enforced when there is contention for a CPU\n\n--cpuset-cpus : limits process to a specific CPU\n\ndocker run -d --cpuset-cpus 0 Restricts to CPU number 0\nCan specify a list or 0,1,2 or a range 0-2\n\n--device\n\nmount your webcam: docker run --device /dev/video0:/dev/video0\n\nShared memory : Hamel this was too advanced for me\n\n\n\nRunning as a user\n\nYou can only inspect the default run-as User by creating or pulling the image\n\nsee p. 113\n\nChange run-as user\n\ndocker run --user nobody\nThe user has to exist in the image when doing this or you will get an error. The user will not be created automatically for you.\nSee available users:\n\ndocker run --rm busybox:latest awk -F: '$0=$1' /etc/passwd\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivileged Containers: TRY NOT TO DO THIS\n\nThis is how you run Docker-in-Docker\nPriviliged containers have root privileges on the host.\n\n--privilged on docker create or docker run\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7 packaging software\nAside: cleaning up your docker environment\ndocker image prune -a and docker container prune\n\nRecovering changes to a stopped container\nI always thought you have to commit changes in order to preserve changes to an image you made in a container. This is not true (although committing changes is a good idea).\nAny changes you make to a container is saved even if the container is exited\nTo recover changes to a container\n\nFind the container (if you didn’t name it with docker run --name it will be named for you), using docker ps -a\nStart the container using docker start -ai &lt;container_name&gt; the -ai flags mean to attach and run interactively\nNow you are in the container you can verify that everything you installed is still there!\n\nNote: if you run your container initially with docker run --rm this automatically removes your container upon exit, so this might not be recommended as your changes are not recoverable if you forget to commit\n\n\n\nSeeing changes to a container from the base image\ndocker diff &lt;container name&gt; will output a long list of of file changes: - A: file added - D: file deleted - C: file changed\n\n\nOther tricks\nYou can override the entry point to the container permanently by using the --entrypoint flag: docker run --entrypoint\n\n\nUnderstanding Images & Layers\n\nfiles are stored in a Union file system, so they are stored in specific layers. The file system you are seeing as an end user are a union of all the layers. Each time a change is made to a union file system, that change is recorded on a new layer on top of all of the others. The “union” of all of those layers, or top-down view, is what the container (and user) sees when accessing the file system.\n\nThis means if you are not careful you can bloat the file system by making a bunch of unnecessary changes to add/delete files.\n\ndocker commit commits the top-layer changes to an image, meaning all the files changes are saved.\n\nSee image size with\ndocker images. Even though you remove a file, the image size will increase! This is because of the Union File System\nSee size of all layers\ndocker history &lt;image name&gt;\nflatten an image This is kind of complicated, you can do this by exporting and importing the filesystem into a base image See pg. 140. BUT there is an experimental feature called docker build --squash -t &lt;image&gt; .You can enable experimental features by following these instructions: dockerd Docker Documentation. For Mac, you can turn on experimental features by setting experimental: true in `settings&gt; Command Line &gt; enable experimental\n\n\n\nChapter 8 Build Automation\n\nuse .dockerignore to prevent certain files from being copied\nYou can set multiple environment variables at once in Dockerfile\nYou can use environment variables in the LABEL command\n\nThe metadata makes it clear that the environment variable substitution works. You can use this form of substitution in the ENV, ADD, COPY, WORKDIR, VOLUME, EXPOSE, and USER instructions.\n\n\nENV APPROOT \"/app\" APP \"mailer.sh\" VERSION \"0.6\"\nLABEL base.name \"Mailer Archetype\" base.version \"${VERSION}\"\n\nview metadata using the command docker inspect &lt;image name&gt;\n\n\nENTRYPOINT something arugment vs. ENTRYPOINT [“something”, “argument”]\nTLDR; use the ugly list approach\nThere are two instruction forms shell form and exec form docker - Dockerfile CMD shell versus exec form - Stack Overflow\nThe ENTRYPOINT instruction has two forms: the shell form and an exec form. The shell form looks like a shell command with whitespace-delimited arguments. The exec form is a string array where the first value is the command to execute and the remaining values are arguments. .\nMost importantly, if the shell form is used for ENTRYPOINT, then all other arguments provided by the CMD instruction or at runtime as extra arguments to docker run will be ignored. This makes the shell form of ENTRYPOINT less flexible.\nOther commands can use the exec form too! You must use the exec form when any of the arguments contain a whitespace:\nFROM dockerinaction/mailer-base:0.6 \nCOPY [\"./log-impl\", \"${APPROOT}\"] \nRUN chmod a+x ${APPROOT}/${APP} && \\ chown example:example /var/log \nUSER example:example \nVOLUME [\"/var/log\"]  # each value in this array will be created as a new volume definition\nCMD [\"/var/log/mailer.log\"]\nNote: you usually don’t want to specify a volume at build time.\n\n\nCMD vs. ENTRYPOINT (You should really try to always use both!)\nCMD is actually an argument list for the ENTRYPOINT.\n\nLogically when you run a container it runs as &lt;default shell program&gt; ENTRYPOINT CMD\nYou can override the ENTRYPOINT with docker run --entrypoint, and you can override commands by just passing commands to docker run : docker run &lt;image name&gt; &lt;command&gt;\n\nFROM ubuntu\n\nENTRYPOINT [ \"ls\" ]\nCMD [\"-lah\"]\nAs you can see using ENTRYPOINT as well as CMD separately provides your downstream users with the most flexibility.\n\n\nCOPY vs ADD\nUse COPY. ADD has additional functionality like ability to download from urls and decompress files, which proved opaque over time and you shouldn’t use it.\n\n\nONBUILD\nThe ONBUILD instruction defines instructions to execute if the resulting image is used as a base for another build. those ONBUILD instructions are executed after the FROM instruction and before the next instruction in a Dockerfile.\nFROM busybox:latest \nWORKDIR /app RUN touch /app/base-evidence \nONBUILD RUN ls -al /app\n\n\nOther Stuff\n\nYou should always validate the presence of required environment variables in a startup shell script like entrypoint.sh\n\n\n\nDocker Digests\nReference the exact SHA of a Container which is the only way to guarantee the image you are referencing has not changed. @ symbol followed by the digest.\nHamel: doesn’t look like a good way to find history of digests, but you can see the current SHA when you use docker pull , you can see the SHA as well if you call docker images --digests\nFROM debian@sha256:d5e87cfcb730...\n\n\n\nChapter 10 (skipped Ch 9)\n\nYou can run your own customized registry. Simplest version can be hosted from a Docker Container!\n\n# start a local registry on port 5000\ndocker run -d --name personal_registry\n \\ -p 5000:5000 --restart=always \n \\ registry:2\n\n# push an image to the registry (using the same image that created the registry for convenience)\ndocker tag registry:2 localhost:5000/distribution:2 \ndocker push localhost:5000/distribution:2\nNote that docker push syntax is actually docker push &lt;registry url&gt;/org/repo\nThis chapter discusses many more things which are skipped: - Centralized registries - Enhancements - Durable blog storage - Integrating through notifications\n\n\nChapter 11 Docker Compose\nDocker compose for fastpages:\nversion: \"3\"\nservices:\n  fastpages: &fastpages\n    working_dir: /data\n    environment:\n        - INPUT_BOOL_SAVE_MARKDOWN=false\n    build:\n      context: ./_action_files\n      dockerfile: ./Dockerfile\n    image: fastpages-dev\n    logging:\n      driver: json-file\n      options:\n        max-size: 50m\n    stdin_open: true\n    tty: true\n    volumes:\n      - .:/data/\n\n  converter:\n    &lt;&lt;: *fastpages\n    command: /fastpages/action_entrypoint.sh\n\n  watcher:\n    &lt;&lt;: *fastpages\n    command: watchmedo shell-command --command /fastpages/action_entrypoint.sh --pattern *.ipynb --recursive --drop\n\n  jekyll:\n    working_dir: /data\n    image: hamelsmu/fastpages-jekyll\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    ports:\n      - \"4000:4000\"\n    volumes:\n      - .:/data/\n    command: &gt;\n     bash -c \"gem install bundler\n     && jekyll serve --trace --strict_front_matter\"\nThe above uses YAML anchors: YAML anchors - Atlassian Documentation\nStart a particular service: docker-compose up &lt;service name&gt; Rebuild a service docker-compose build &lt;service name&gt;\nYou can express dependencies with depends_on which is useful for compose to know which services to restart or start in a specified order.\nSee examples of Docker Compose files on p 243\n\nScaling Up w/Docker Compose\nThat’s right you don’t need docker swarm. This example uses ch11_coffee_api/docker-compose.yml at master · dockerinaction/ch11_coffee_api · GitHub\n\nGet list of containers that are currently providing the service.\n\ndocker-compose ps coffee\n          Name                 Command       State            Ports\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nch11_coffee_api_coffee_1   ./entrypoint.sh   Up      0.0.0.0:32768-&gt;3000/tcp\n\nScale it up with docker-compose up --scale\n\ndocker-compose up --scale coffee=5\nWhen you run docker-compose ps coffee:\ndocker-compose ps coffee                                                                                                                         ✔\n          Name                 Command       State            Ports\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nch11_coffee_api_coffee_1   ./entrypoint.sh   Up      0.0.0.0:32768-&gt;3000/tcp\nch11_coffee_api_coffee_2   ./entrypoint.sh   Up      0.0.0.0:32769-&gt;3000/tcp\nch11_coffee_api_coffee_3   ./entrypoint.sh   Up      0.0.0.0:32771-&gt;3000/tcp\nch11_coffee_api_coffee_4   ./entrypoint.sh   Up      0.0.0.0:32770-&gt;3000/tcp\nch11_coffee_api_coffee_5   ./entrypoint.sh   Up      0.0.0.0:32772-&gt;3000/tcp\nNote that the coffee service binds to port 0 on your host, which is an ephemeral port, which just means that your host machine assigns the service to a random port. This is required if you plan on using docker compose up --scale\nThe service was bound to port 0 on the host with\ncoffee:\n  build: ./coffee\n  user: 777:777\n  restart: always\n  expose:\n    - 3000\n  ports:\n    - \"0:3000\"\n...\n\nLoad balancer\n\nProblem with this kind of scaling is you don’t know the ports in advance , and you don’t want to hit these individual endpoints, you need a load balancer. This blog post shows you how to luse NGINX as a load balancer.\nYou will need something like this in your compose file\n  nginx:\n    image: nginx:latest\n    volumes:\n      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro\n    depends_on:\n      - pspdfkit\n    ports:\n      - \"4000:4000\"\n\n\nTemplating Docker Compose Files\nYou can read about this here: Share Compose configurations between files and projects | Docker Documentation, allows you to override certain things from a base compose file.\n\n\n\nChapter 12 Clusters w/Machine & Swarm\nHamel: I skipped this completely",

You could add additional case studies and real-world insights. If you deeply engage with someone’s work and add your insights, they often share your content with their audience. Not because you asked, but because you’ve added something meaningful to their work. Swyx has written a great post on how to do this effectively.\nThe key is authenticity. Don’t do this just for marketing—do it because you’re genuinely interested in learning from others and building on their ideas. It’s not hard to find things to be excited about.

Finally, don’t just post into the void. Engage with others. When someone comments on your post, reply thoughtfully. When you see conversations where you can add value, provide helpful information.\nFinally, don’t be discouraged if you don’t see results immediately. Here’s some advice from my friend (and prolific writer), Eugene Yan:\n\nIn the beginning, when most people start writing, the output’s gonna suck. Harsh, but true—my first 100 posts or so were crap. But with practice, people can get better. But they have to be deliberate in wanting to practice and get better with each piece, and not just write for the sake of publishing something and tweeting about it. The Sam Parr course (see below) is a great example of deliberate practice on copywriting."

Small improvements in how you communicate can make a huge difference in how your content lands.\nOne thing Sam teaches is that big words don’t make you sound smart. Clear writing that avoids jargon is more effective. That’s why Sam teaches aiming for a 6th-grade reading level. This matters even more with AI, as AI loves to generate flowery language and long sentences. The Hemingway App can be helpful in helping you simplify your writing.1"

    "text": "4. Build a Voice-to-Content Pipeline\nThe struggle most people have with creating content is that it takes too much time. But it doesn’t have to if you build the right systems, especially with AI.\nGetting this system right takes some upfront work, but the payoff is enormous. Start by installing a good voice-to-text app on your phone. I use either Superwhisper or VoicePal. VoicePal is great for prompting you to elaborate with follow-up questions. These tools let me capture ideas at their best. That’s usually when I’m walking outside or away from my computer. At my computer, I use Flow.\nThe key is to carefully craft your first few pieces of content. These become examples for your prompts that teach AI your style and tone. Once you have high-quality examples, you can organize these (transcript, content) pairs and feed them to language models. The in-context learning creates remarkably aligned output that matches your writing style while maintaining the authenticity of your original thoughts.\nFor example, I use this pipeline at Answer AI. We have started interviewing each other and using the recordings as grounding for blog posts. Our recent post about SolveIt shows this in action. The raw conversation is the foundation. Our workflow turns it into polished content.\nI’ve also integrated this workflow into my meetings. Using CircleBack, my favorite AI note-taking app, I can automatically capture and process meeting discussions. You can set up workflows to send your meeting notes and transcripts to AI for processing. This turns conversations into content opportunities.\nThe real power comes from having all these pieces working together. Voice capture, AI, and automation makes content creation fun and manageable."

They also have inpainting, background removal, and more.\nIf using X, social cards can be a bit fiddly.

To mitigate this,I use Canva to write the post’s title in the image like this.\nSocial media can be distracting, so I like to schedule my posts in advance. I use typefully for this purpose. Some of my friends use hypefury.\n\nFinally, when posting on X, threads can be a great way to raise the visibility of your content.

The prompts sent by these tools to the LLM is a natural language description of what these tools are doing, and is the fastest way to understand how they work. Furthermore, some tools have dense terminology to describe internal constructs which can further obfuscate what they are doing.\nFor reasons I’ll explain below, I think most people would benefit from the following mindset:\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this blog post, I’ll show you how you can intercept API calls w/prompts for any tool, without having to fumble through docs or read source code.

    "text": "Motivation: Minimize accidental complexity\nBefore adopting an abstraction, its important to consider the dangers of taking on accidental complexity. This danger is acute for LLM abstractions relative to programming abstractions. With LLM abstractions, we often force the user to regress towards writing code instead of conversing with the AI in natural language, which can run counter to the purpose of LLMs:\n\n\n\nProgramming abstraction -&gt; a human-like language you can use to translate your task into machine codeLLM abstraction -&gt; an unintelligible framework you can use to translate your task into human language\n\n— Hamel Husain (@HamelHusain) February 5, 2024\n\n\n\nWhile this is a cheeky comment, it’s worth keeping this in mind while evaluating tools. There are two primary types of automation that tools provide:\n\nInterleaving code and LLMs: Expressing this automation is often best done through code, since code must be run to carry out the task. Examples include routing, executing functions, retries, chaining, etc.\nRe-Writing and constructing prompts: Expressing your intent is often best done through natural language. However, there are exceptions! For example, it is convenient to express a function definition or schema from code instead of natural language.\n\nMany frameworks offer both types of automation. However, going too far with the second type can have negative consequences. Seeing the prompt allows you decide:\n\nIs this framework really necessary?\nShould I just steal the final prompt (a string) and jettison the framework?\nCan we write a better prompt than this (shorter, aligned with your intent, etc)?\nIs this the best approach (do the # of API calls seem appropriate)?\n\nIn my experience, seeing the prompts and API calls are essential to making informed decisions."

    "text": "Intercepting LLM API calls\nThere are many possible ways to intercept LLM API calls, such as monkey patching source code or finding a user-facing option. I’ve found that those approaches take far too much time since the quality of source code and documentation can vary greatly. After all, I just want to see API calls without worrying about how the code works!\nA framework agnostic way to see API calls is to setup a proxy that logs your outgoing API requests. This is easy to do with mitmproxy, an free, open-source HTTPS proxy.\n\nSetting Up mitmproxy\nThis is an opinionated way to setup mitmproxythat’s beginner-friendly for our intended purposes:\n\nFollow the installation instructions on the website\nStart the interactive UI by running mitmweb in the terminal. Pay attention to the url of the interactive UI in the logs which will look something like this: Web server listening at http://127.0.0.1:8081/\nNext, you need to configure your device (i.e. your laptop) to route all traffic through mitproxy, which listens on http://localhost:8080. Per the documentation:\n\nWe recommend to simply search the web on how to configure an HTTP proxy for your system. Some operating system have a global settings, some browser have their own, other applications use environment variables, etc.\n\nIn my case, A google search for “set proxy for macos” returned these results:\n\nchoose Apple menu &gt; System Settings, click Network in the sidebar, click a network service on the right, click Details, then click Proxies.\n\nI then insert localhost and 8080 in the following places in the UI:\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, navigate to http://mitm.it and it will give you instructions on how to install the mitmproxy Certificate Authority (CA), which you will need for intercepting HTTPS requests. (You can also do this manually here.) Also, take note of the location of the CA file as we will reference it later.\nYou can test that everything works by browsing to a website like https://mitmproxy.org/, and seeing the corresponding output in the mtimweb UI which for me is located at http://127.0.0.1:8081/ (look at the logs in your terminal to get the URL).\nNow that you set everything up, you can disable the proxy that you previously enabled on your network. I do this on my mac by toggling the proxy buttons in the screenshot I showed above. This is because we want to scope the proxy to only the python program to eliminate unnecessary noise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nNetworking related software commonly allows you to proxy outgoing requests by setting environment variables. This is the approach we will use to scope our proxy to specific Python programs. However, I encourage you to play with other types of programs to see what you find after you are comfortable!\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment variables for Python\nWe need to set the following environment variables so that the requests and httpx libraries will direct traffic to the proxy and reference the CA file for HTTPS traffic:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMake sure you set these environment variables before running any of the code snippets in this blog post.\n\n\n\nimport os\n# The location of my CA File\ncert_file = '/Users/hamel/Downloads/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem' \nos.environ['REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE'] = cert_file\nos.environ['SSL_CERT_FILE'] = cert_file\nos.environ['HTTPS_PROXY'] = 'http://127.0.0.1:8080'\n\nYou can do a minimal test by running the following code:\n\nimport requests\nrequests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', \n              data={'key': 'value'})\n\n&lt;Response [200]&gt;\n\n\nThis will appear in the UI like so:"

    "text": "Examples\nNow for the fun part, let’s run through some examples of LLM libraries and intercept their API calls!\n\nGuardrails\nGuardrails allows you specify structure and types, which it uses to validate and correct the outputs of large language models. This is a hello world example from the guardrails-ai/guardrails README:\n\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom guardrails import Guard\nimport openai\n\nclass Pet(BaseModel):\n    pet_type: str = Field(description=\"Species of pet\")\n    name: str = Field(description=\"a unique pet name\")\n\nprompt = \"\"\"\n    What kind of pet should I get and what should I name it?\n\n    ${gr.complete_json_suffix_v2}\n\"\"\"\nguard = Guard.from_pydantic(output_class=Pet, prompt=prompt)\n\nvalidated_output, *rest = guard(\n    llm_api=openai.completions.create,\n    engine=\"gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct\"\n)\n\nprint(f\"{validated_output}\")\n\n{\n    \"pet_type\": \"dog\",\n    \"name\": \"Buddy\n\n\nWhat is happening here? How is this structured output and validation working? Looking at the mitmproxy UI, I can see that the above code resulted in two LLM API calls, the first one with this prompt:\nWhat kind of pet should I get and what should I name it?\n\n    \nGiven below is XML that describes the information to extract from this document and the tags to extract it into.\n\n&lt;output&gt;\n    &lt;string name=\"pet_type\" description=\"Species of pet\"/&gt;\n    &lt;string name=\"name\" description=\"a unique pet name\"/&gt;\n&lt;/output&gt;\n\n\nONLY return a valid JSON object (no other text is necessary), where the key of the field in JSON is the `name` attribute of the corresponding XML, and the value is of the type specified by the corresponding XML's tag. The JSON MUST conform to the XML format, including any types and format requests e.g. requests for lists, objects and specific types. Be correct and concise.\n\nHere are examples of simple (XML, JSON) pairs that show the expected behavior:\n- `&lt;string name='foo' format='two-words lower-case' /&gt;` =&gt; `{'foo': 'example one'}`\n- `&lt;list name='bar'&gt;&lt;string format='upper-case' /&gt;&lt;/list&gt;` =&gt; `{\"bar\": ['STRING ONE', 'STRING TWO', etc.]}`\n- `&lt;object name='baz'&gt;&lt;string name=\"foo\" format=\"capitalize two-words\" /&gt;&lt;integer name=\"index\" format=\"1-indexed\" /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;` =&gt; `{'baz': {'foo': 'Some String', 'index': 1}}`\nFollowed by another call with this prompt:\nI was given the following response, which was not parseable as JSON.\n\n\"{\\n    \\\"pet_type\\\": \\\"dog\\\",\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"Buddy\"\n\nHelp me correct this by making it valid JSON.\n\nGiven below is XML that describes the information to extract from this document and the tags to extract it into.\n\n&lt;output&gt;\n    &lt;string name=\"pet_type\" description=\"Species of pet\"/&gt;\n    &lt;string name=\"name\" description=\"a unique pet name\"/&gt;\n&lt;/output&gt;\n\n\nONLY return a valid JSON object (no other text is necessary), where the key of the field in JSON is the `name` attribute of the corresponding XML, and the value is of the type specified by the corresponding XML's tag. The JSON MUST conform to the XML format, including any types and format requests e.g. requests for lists, objects and specific types. Be correct and concise. If you are unsure anywhere, enter `null`.\nWoof. That’s a whole lot of ceremony to get structured output! We learned that this library’s approach to structured output uses XML schemas (while others use function calling). It’s worth considering if you can fashion a better or simpler approach now that the magic has been lifted. Either way, we now have insight into how it works without dragging you into unnecessary complexity, which is a win.\n\n\nGuidance\nGuidance offers constrained generation and programming constructs for writing prompts. Let’s dive into a chat example from their tutorials:\n\nimport guidance\ngpt35 = guidance.models.OpenAI(\"gpt-3.5-turbo\")\n\nimport re\nfrom guidance import gen, select, system, user, assistant\n\n@guidance\ndef plan_for_goal(lm, goal: str):\n    \n    # This is a helper function which we will use below\n    def parse_best(prosandcons, options):\n        best = re.search(r'Best=(\\d+)', prosandcons)\n        if not best:\n            best =  re.search(r'Best.*?(\\d+)', 'Best= option is 3')\n        if best:\n            best = int(best.group(1))\n        else:\n            best = 0\n        return options[best]\n\n    # Some general instruction to the model\n    with system():\n        lm += \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n\n    # Simulate a simple request from the user\n    # Note that we switch to using 'lm2' here, because these are intermediate steps (so we don't want to overwrite the current lm object)\n    with user():\n        lm2 = lm + f\"\"\"\\\n        I want to {goal}\n        Can you please generate one option for how to accomplish this?\n        Please make the option very short, at most one line.\"\"\"\n\n    # Generate several options. Note that this means several sequential generation requests\n    n_options = 5\n    with assistant():\n        options = []\n        for i in range(n_options):\n            options.append((lm2 + gen(name='option', temperature=1.0, max_tokens=50))[\"option\"])\n\n    # Have the user request pros and cons\n    with user():\n        lm2 += f\"\"\"\\\n        I want to {goal}\n        Can you please comment on the pros and cons of each of the following options, and then pick the best option?\n        ---\n        \"\"\"\n        for i, opt in enumerate(options):\n            lm2 += f\"Option {i}: {opt}\\n\"\n        lm2 += f\"\"\"\\\n        ---\n        Please discuss each option very briefly (one line for pros, one for cons), and end by saying Best=X, where X is the number of the best option.\"\"\"\n\n    # Get the pros and cons from the model\n    with assistant():\n        lm2 += gen(name='prosandcons', temperature=0.0, max_tokens=600, stop=\"Best=\") + \"Best=\" + gen(\"best\", regex=\"[0-9]+\") \n\n    # The user now extracts the one selected as the best, and asks for a full plan\n    # We switch back to 'lm' because this is the final result we want\n    with user():\n        lm += f\"\"\"\\\n        I want to {goal}\n        Here is my plan: {options[int(lm2[\"best\"])]}\n        Please elaborate on this plan, and tell me how to best accomplish it.\"\"\"\n\n    # The plan is generated\n    with assistant():\n        lm += gen(name='plan', max_tokens=500)\n\n    return lm\n\n\nresults = gpt35 + plan_for_goal(goal=\"read more books\")\n\nsystemYou are a helpful assistant.userI want to read more books\nHere is my plan: Set aside 30 minutes of dedicated reading time each day.\nPlease elaborate on this plan, and tell me how to best accomplish it.assistantSetting aside 30 minutes of dedicated reading time each day is a great plan to read more books. Here are some tips to help you accomplish this goal:\n\n1. Establish a routine: Choose a specific time of day that works best for you, whether it's in the morning, during lunch break, or before bed. Consistency is key to forming a habit.\n\n2. Create a reading-friendly environment: Find a quiet and comfortable spot where you can focus on your reading without distractions. It could be a cozy corner in your home, a park bench, or a local library.\n\n3. Minimize distractions: Put away your phone, turn off the TV, and avoid any other potential interruptions during your dedicated reading time. This will help you stay focused and fully immerse yourself in the book.\n\n4. Choose books that interest you: Select books that align with your personal interests, hobbies, or goals. When you're genuinely interested in the subject matter, you'll be more motivated to read regularly.\n\n5. Start with manageable goals: If you're new to reading or have a busy schedule, start with a smaller time commitment, such as 15 minutes, and gradually increase it to 30 minutes or more as you become more comfortable.\n\n6. Set a timer: Use a timer or a reading app that allows you to track your reading time. This will help you stay accountable and ensure that you dedicate the full 30 minutes to reading.\n\n7. Make reading enjoyable: Create a cozy reading atmosphere by lighting a candle, sipping a cup of tea, or playing soft background music. Engaging all your senses can enhance your reading experience.\n\n8. Join a book club or reading group: Consider joining a book club or participating in a reading group to connect with fellow book lovers. This can provide additional motivation, discussion opportunities, and book recommendations.\n\n9. Keep a reading log: Maintain a record of the books you've read, along with your thoughts and reflections. This can help you track your progress, discover patterns in your reading preferences, and serve as a source of inspiration for future reading.\n\n10. Be flexible: While it's important to have a dedicated reading time, be flexible and adaptable. Life can sometimes get busy, so if you miss a day, don't be discouraged. Simply pick up where you left off and continue with your reading routine.\n\nRemember, the goal is to enjoy the process of reading and make it a regular part of your life. Happy reading!\n\n\nThis looks pretty neat! But what is it doing exactly? This makes a total of 7 calls to OpenAI, which I have put in this gist. 5 of 7 of these API calls are “internal” thoughts asking the LLM to generate ideas. Even though the temperature is set to 1.0, these “ideas” are mostly redundant. The penultimate call to OpenAI enumerates these “ideas” which I’ve included below:\n\n\nI want to read more books\nCan you please comment on the pros and cons of each of the following options, and then pick the best option?\n---\nOption 0: Set aside dedicated time each day for reading.\nOption 1: Set aside 30 minutes of dedicated reading time each day.\nOption 2: Set aside dedicated time each day for reading.\nOption 3: Set aside dedicated time each day for reading.\nOption 4: Join a book club.\n---\nPlease discuss each option very briefly (one line for pros, one for cons), and end by saying Best=X, where X is the number of the best option.\n\n\nI know from experience that you are likely to get better results if you tell the language model to generate ideas in one shot. That way, the LLM can reference previous ideas and achieve more diversity. This is a good example of accidental complexity: its very tempting to take this design pattern and apply it blindly. This is less of a critique of this particular framework, since the code makes it clear that 5 independent calls will happen. Either way, its good idea to check your work by inspecting API calls!.\n\n\nLangchain\nLangchain is a multi-tool for all things LLM. Lots of people rely on Langchain when get started with LLMs. The core LangChain library doesn’t generally hide prompts from you, however there are experimental features that do. Let’s take a look at one of these features called SmartLLMChain:\n\nfrom langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\nfrom langchain_experimental.smart_llm import SmartLLMChain\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n\nhard_question = \"I have a 12 liter jug and a 6 liter jug.\\\nI want to measure 6 liters. How do I do it?\"\nprompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(hard_question)\nllm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0, model_name=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\")\n\n\nchain = SmartLLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt, \n                      n_ideas=2, \n                      verbose=True)\nresult = chain.run({})\n\n\nprint(result)\n\nIdea 1: 1. Fill the 12 liter jug completely.\n2. Pour the contents of the 12 liter jug into the 6 liter jug. This will leave you with 6 liters in the 12 liter jug.\n3. Empty the 6 liter jug.\n4. Pour the remaining 6 liters from the 12 liter jug into the now empty 6 liter jug.\n5. You now have 6 liters in the 6 liter jug.\n\nIdea 2: 1. Fill the 12 liter jug completely.\n2. Pour the contents of the 12 liter jug into the 6 liter jug. This will leave you with 6 liters in the 12 liter jug.\n3. Empty the 6 liter jug.\n4. Pour the remaining 6 liters from the 12 liter jug into the now empty 6 liter jug.\n5. You now have 6 liters in the 6 liter jug.\n\nImproved Answer:\n1. Fill the 12 liter jug completely.\n2. Pour the contents of the 12 liter jug into the 6 liter jug until the 6 liter jug is full. This will leave you with 6 liters in the 12 liter jug and the 6 liter jug completely filled.\n3. Empty the 6 liter jug.\n4. Pour the remaining 6 liters from the 12 liter jug into the now empty 6 liter jug.\n5. You now have 6 liters in the 6 liter jug.\n\nFull Answer:\nTo measure 6 liters using a 12 liter jug and a 6 liter jug, follow these steps:\n1. Fill the 12 liter jug completely.\n2. Pour the contents of the 12 liter jug into the 6 liter jug until the 6 liter jug is full. This will leave you with 6 liters in the 12 liter jug and the 6 liter jug completely filled.\n3. Empty the 6 liter jug.\n4. Pour the remaining 6 liters from the 12 liter jug into the now empty 6 liter jug.\n5. You now have 6 liters in the 6 liter jug.\n\n\nNeat! So what happened exactly? While this API emits logs that show you a lot of information (available on this gist), the API request pattern is interesting:\n\nTwo seperate api calls for each “idea”.\nAnother API call that incorporates the two ideas as context, with the prompt:\n\nYou are a researcher tasked with investigating the 2 response options provided. List the flaws and faulty logic of each answer options. Let’w work this out in a step by step way to be sure we have all the errors:”\n\nA final API call that that takes the critique from step 2 and generates an answer.\n\nIts not clear that this approach is optimal. I am not sure it should take 4 separate API calls to accomplish this task. Perhaps the critique and the final answer could be generated in one step? Furthermore, the prompt has a spelling error (Let'w) and also overly focuses on the negative about identifying errors - which makes me skeptical that this prompt has been optimized or tested.\n\n\nInstructor\nInstructor is a framework for structured outputs.\n\nStructred data extraction with Pydantic\nHere is a basic example from the project’s README that allows you to extract structured data by using Pydantic to define your schema.\n\nimport instructor\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n\nclient = instructor.patch(OpenAI())\n\nclass UserDetail(BaseModel):\n    name: str\n    age: int\n\nuser = client.chat.completions.create(\n    model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    response_model=UserDetail,\n    messages=[{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Extract Jason is 25 years old\"}])\n\nWe can see how this works by inspecting the API call logged to mitmproxy:\n{\n    \"function_call\": {\n        \"name\": \"UserDetail\"\n    },\n    \"functions\": [\n        {\n            \"description\": \"Correctly extracted `UserDetail` with all the required parameters with correct types\",\n            \"name\": \"UserDetail\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"age\": {\n                        \"title\": \"Age\",\n                        \"type\": \"integer\"\n                    },\n                    \"name\": {\n                        \"title\": \"Name\",\n                        \"type\": \"string\"\n                    }\n                },\n                \"required\": [\n                    \"age\",\n                    \"name\"\n                ],\n                \"type\": \"object\"\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"content\": \"Extract Jason is 25 years old\",\n            \"role\": \"user\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\"\n}\nThis is great. For structured output - It does exactly what I want, and it correctly uses the OpenAI API the way I would use it if I were writing this manually (by defining a function schema). I would consider this specific API a zero-cost abstraction, meaning it does exactly what I expect it to with a minimal surface area.\n\n\nValidation\nHowever, instructor has other APIs that are more agressive and write prompts for you. For example, consider this validation example. Running through that example should trigger similar questions to the exploration of Langchain’s SmartLLMChain above. In this example, you will observe 3 LLM API calls to get the right answer, with the final payload looking like this:\n{\n    \"function_call\": {\n        \"name\": \"Validator\"\n    },\n    \"functions\": [\n        {\n            \"description\": \"Validate if an attribute is correct and if not,\\nreturn a new value with an error message\",\n            \"name\": \"Validator\",\n            \"parameters\": {\n                \"properties\": {\n                    \"fixed_value\": {\n                        \"anyOf\": [\n                            {\n                                \"type\": \"string\"\n                            },\n                            {\n                                \"type\": \"null\"\n                            }\n                        ],\n                        \"default\": null,\n                        \"description\": \"If the attribute is not valid, suggest a new value for the attribute\",\n                        \"title\": \"Fixed Value\"\n                    },\n                    \"is_valid\": {\n                        \"default\": true,\n                        \"description\": \"Whether the attribute is valid based on the requirements\",\n                        \"title\": \"Is Valid\",\n                        \"type\": \"boolean\"\n                    },\n                    \"reason\": {\n                        \"anyOf\": [\n                            {\n                                \"type\": \"string\"\n                            },\n                            {\n                                \"type\": \"null\"\n                            }\n                        ],\n                        \"default\": null,\n                        \"description\": \"The error message if the attribute is not valid, otherwise None\",\n                        \"title\": \"Reason\"\n                    }\n                },\n                \"required\": [],\n                \"type\": \"object\"\n            }\n        }\n    ],\n    \"messages\": [\n        {\n            \"content\": \"You are a world class validation model. Capable to determine if the following value is valid for the statement, if it is not, explain why and suggest a new value.\",\n            \"role\": \"system\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"content\": \"Does `According to some perspectives, the meaning of life is to find purpose, happiness, and fulfillment. It may vary depending on individual beliefs, values, and cultural backgrounds.` follow the rules: don't say objectionable things\",\n            \"role\": \"user\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo\",\n    \"temperature\": 0\n}\nConcretely, I’m curious if these steps could be collapsed into two LLM calls instead of three. Furthermore, I wonder if generic validation functions (as supplied in the above payload) are the right way to critique output? I don’t know the answer, but this is an interesting design pattern that is worth poking at.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAs far as LLM frameworks go, I really like this one. The core functionality of defining schemas with Pydantic is very convenient. The code is also very readable and easy to understand. Despite this, I still found it helpful to intercept instructor’s API calls to get another perspective.\nThere is a way to set a logging level in instructor to see the raw API calls, however, I like using a framework agnostic approach :)\n\n\n\n\n\nDSPy\nDSPy is the framework that helps you optimize your prompts to optimize any arbitrary metric. There is a fairly steep learning curve to DSPy, partly because it introduces many new technical terms specific to its framework like compilers and teleprompters. However, we can quickly peel back the complexity by looking at the API calls that it makes!\nLet’s run the minimal working example:\n\nimport time\nimport dspy\nfrom dspy.datasets.gsm8k import GSM8K, gsm8k_metric\nstart_time = time.time()\n\n# Set up the LM\nturbo = dspy.OpenAI(model='gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct', max_tokens=250)\ndspy.settings.configure(lm=turbo)\n\n# Load math questions from the GSM8K dataset\ngms8k = GSM8K()\ntrainset, devset = gms8k.train, gms8k.dev\n\n\nclass CoT(dspy.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.prog = dspy.ChainOfThought(\"question -&gt; answer\")\n    \n    def forward(self, question):\n        return self.prog(question=question)\n\n\nfrom dspy.teleprompt import BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch\n\n# Set up the optimizer: we want to \"bootstrap\" (i.e., self-generate) 8-shot examples of our CoT program.\n# The optimizer will repeat this 10 times (plus some initial attempts) before selecting its best attempt on the devset.\nconfig = dict(max_bootstrapped_demos=8, max_labeled_demos=8, num_candidate_programs=10, num_threads=4)\n\n# Optimize! Use the `gms8k_metric` here. In general, the metric is going to tell the optimizer how well it's doing.\nteleprompter = BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch(metric=gsm8k_metric, **config)\noptimized_cot = teleprompter.compile(CoT(), trainset=trainset, valset=devset)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis was not very minimal\n\n\n\nDespite this being the official quick-start/minimal working example, this code took more than 30 minutes to run, and made hundreds of calls to OpenAI! This cost non-trivial time (and money), especially as an entry-point to the library for someone trying to take a look. There was no prior warning that this would happen.\n\n\nDSPy made 100s of API calls because it was iteratively sampling examples for a few-shot prompt and selecting the best ones according to the gsm8k_metric on a validation set. I was able to quickly understand this by scanning through the API requests logged to mitmproxy.\nDSPy offers an inspect_history method which allows you to see the the last n prompts and their completions:\nturbo.inspect_history(n=1)\nI was able to verify that these prompts matched the last few API calls being made in mitmproxy. Overall, I would be motivated to potentially keep the prompt and and jettison the library. That being said, I think I am curious to see how this library evolves."

However, I’ve witnessed too many people fall into the trap of using these libraries without understanding what they are doing.\nOne thing I focus on as an independent consultant is to make sure my clients don’t take on accidental complexity. It’s very tempting to adopt additional tools given all the excitement around LLMs. Looking at prompts is one way to mitigate that temptation.\nI’m wary of frameworks that distance the human too far from LLMs. By whispering “Fuck you, show me the prompt!” when using these tools, you are empowered to decide for yourself.1\n \n\nAcknowledgments: Thanks to Jeremy Howard and Ben Clavie for thoughtfully reviewing this post."

    "text": "1. The Most Common Mistake: Skipping Error Analysis\nThe “tools first” mindset is the most common mistake in AI development. Teams get caught up in architecture diagrams, frameworks, and dashboards while neglecting the process of actually understanding what’s working and what isn’t.\nOne client proudly showed me this evaluation dashboard:\n\n\n\nThe kind of dashboard that foreshadows failure.\n\n\nThis is the “tools trap” – the belief that adopting the right tools or frameworks (in this case, generic metrics) will solve your AI problems. Generic metrics are worse than useless – they actively impede progress in two ways:\nFirst, they create a false sense of measurement and progress. Teams think they’re data-driven because they have dashboards, but they’re tracking vanity metrics that don’t correlate with real user problems. I’ve seen teams celebrate improving their “helpfulness score” by 10% while their actual users were still struggling with basic tasks. It’s like optimizing your website’s load time while your checkout process is broken – you’re getting better at the wrong thing.\nSecond, too many metrics fragment your attention. Instead of focusing on the few metrics that matter for your specific use case, you’re trying to optimize multiple dimensions simultaneously. When everything is important, nothing is.\nThe alternative? Error analysis - the single most valuable activity in AI development and consistently the highest-ROI activity. Let me show you what effective error analysis looks like in practice.\n\nThe Error Analysis Process\nWhen Jacob, the founder of Nurture Boss, needed to improve their apartment-industry AI assistant, his team built a simple viewer to examine conversations between their AI and users. Next to each conversation was a space for open-ended notes about failure modes.\nAfter annotating dozens of conversations, clear patterns emerged. Their AI was struggling with date handling – failing 66% of the time when users said things like “let’s schedule a tour two weeks from now.”\nInstead of reaching for new tools, they: 1. Looked at actual conversation logs 2. Categorized the types of date-handling failures 3. Built specific tests to catch these issues 4. Measured improvement on these metrics\nThe result? Their date handling success rate improved from 33% to 95%.\nHere’s Jacob explaining this process himself:\n\n\n\nBottom-Up vs. Top-Down Analysis\nWhen identifying error types, you can take either a “top-down” or “bottom-up” approach.\nThe top-down approach starts with common metrics like “hallucination” or “toxicity” plus metrics unique to your task. While convenient, it often misses domain-specific issues.\nThe more effective bottom-up approach forces you to look at actual data and let metrics naturally emerge. At NurtureBoss, we started with a spreadsheet where each row represented a conversation. We wrote open-ended notes on any undesired behavior. Then we used an LLM to build a taxonomy of common failure modes. Finally, we mapped each row to specific failure mode labels and counted the frequency of each issue.\nThe results were striking - just three issues accounted for over 60% of all problems:\n\n\n\nExcel Pivot Tables are a simple tool, but they work!\n\n\n\nConversation flow issues (missing context, awkward responses)\nHandoff failures (not recognizing when to transfer to humans)\nRescheduling problems (struggling with date handling)\n\nThe impact was immediate. Jacob’s team had uncovered so many actionable insights that they needed several weeks just to implement fixes for the problems we’d already found.\nIf you’d like to see error analysis in action, we recorded a live walkthrough here.\nThis brings us to a crucial question: How do you make it easy for teams to look at their data? The answer leads us to what I consider the most important investment any AI team can make…"

    "text": "2. The Most Important AI Investment: A Simple Data Viewer\nThe single most impactful investment I’ve seen AI teams make isn’t a fancy evaluation dashboard – it’s building a customized interface that lets anyone examine what their AI is actually doing. I emphasize customized because every domain has unique needs that off-the-shelf tools rarely address. When reviewing apartment leasing conversations, you need to see the full chat history and scheduling context. For real estate queries, you need the property details and source documents right there. Even small UX decisions – like where to place metadata or which filters to expose – can make the difference between a tool people actually use and one they avoid.\nI’ve watched teams struggle with generic labeling interfaces, hunting through multiple systems just to understand a single interaction. The friction adds up: clicking through to different systems to see context, copying error descriptions into separate tracking sheets, switching between tools to verify information. This friction doesn’t just slow teams down – it actively discourages the kind of systematic analysis that catches subtle issues.\nTeams with thoughtfully designed data viewers iterate 10x faster than those without them. And here’s the thing: these tools can be built in hours using AI-assisted development (like Cursor or Loveable). The investment is minimal compared to the returns.\nLet me show you what I mean. Here’s the data viewer built for NurtureBoss (which we discussed earlier):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSearch and filter sessions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnotate and add notes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAggregate and count errors\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s what makes a good data annotation tool:\n\nShow all context in one place. Don’t make users hunt through different systems to understand what happened.\n\nMake feedback trivial to capture. One-click correct/incorrect buttons beat lengthy forms.\nCapture open-ended feedback. This lets you capture nuanced issues that don’t fit into a pre-defined taxonomy.\nEnable quick filtering and sorting. Teams need to easily dive into specific error types. In the example above, NurtureBoss can quickly filter by the channel (voice, text, chat) or the specific property they want to look at quickly.\nHave hotkeys that allow users to navigate between data examples and annotate without clicking.\n\nIt doesn’t matter what web frameworks you use - use whatever you are familiar with. Because I’m a python developer, my current favorite web framework is FastHTML coupled with MonsterUI, because it allows me to define the back-end and front-end code in one small python file.\nThe key is starting somewhere, even if it’s simple. I’ve found custom web apps provide the best experience, but if you’re just beginning, a spreadsheet is better than nothing. As your needs grow, you can evolve your tools accordingly.\nThis brings us to another counter-intuitive lesson: the people best positioned to improve your AI system are often the ones who know the least about AI."

    "text": "3. Empower Domain Experts To Write Prompts\nI recently worked with an education startup building an interactive learning platform with LLMs. Their product manager, a learning design expert, would create detailed PowerPoint decks explaining pedagogical principles and example dialogues. She’d present these to the engineering team, who would then translate her expertise into prompts.\nBut here’s the thing: prompts are just English. Having a learning expert communicate teaching principles through PowerPoint, only for engineers to translate that back into English prompts, created unnecessary friction. The most successful teams flip this model by giving domain experts tools to write and iterate on prompts directly.\n\nBuild Bridges, Not Gatekeepers\nPrompt playgrounds are a great starting point for this. Tools like Arize, Langsmith and Braintrust let teams quickly test different prompts, feed in example datasets, and compare results. Here are some screenshots of these tools:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArize Phoenix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLangSmith\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBraintrust\n\n\n\n\n\nBut there’s a crucial next step that many teams miss: integrating prompt development into their application context. Most AI applications aren’t just prompts – They commonly involve RAG systems pulling from your knowledge base, agent orchestration coordinating multiple steps, and application-specific business logic. The most effective teams I’ve worked with go beyond standalone playgrounds. They build what I call integrated prompt environments – essentially admin versions of their actual user interface that expose prompt editing.\nHere’s an illustration of what an integrated prompt environment might look like for a real estate AI assistant:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe UI that users (real estate agents) see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe same UI, but with an “admin mode”used by the engineering & product team to iterate on the prompt and debug issues.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips For Communicating With Domain Experts\nThere’s another barrier that often prevents domain experts from contributing effectively: unnecessary jargon. I was working with an education startup where engineers, product managers, and learning specialists were talking past each other in meetings. The engineers kept saying, “We’re going to build an agent that does XYZ,” when really the job to be done was writing a prompt. This created an artificial barrier – the learning specialists, who were the actual domain experts, felt like they couldn’t contribute because they didn’t understand “agents.”\nThis happens everywhere. I’ve seen it with lawyers at legal tech companies, psychologists at mental health startups, and doctors at healthcare firms. The magic of LLMs is that they make AI accessible through natural language, but we often destroy that advantage by wrapping everything in technical terminology.\nHere’s a simple example of how to translate common AI jargon:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead of saying…\nSay…\n\n\n\n\n“We’re implementing a RAG approach”\n“We’re making sure the model has the right context to answer questions”\n\n\n“We need to prevent prompt injection”\n“We need to make sure users can’t trick the AI into ignoring our rules”\n\n\n“Our model suffers from hallucination issues”\n“Sometimes the AI makes things up, so we need to check its answers”\n\n\n\nThis doesn’t mean dumbing things down – it means being precise about what you’re actually doing. When you say “we’re building an agent,” what specific capability are you adding? Is it function calling? Tool use? Or just a better prompt? Being specific helps everyone understand what’s actually happening.\nThere’s nuance here. Technical terminology exists for a reason – it provides precision when talking with other technical stakeholders. The key is adapting your language to your audience.\nThe challenge many teams raise at this point is: “This all sounds great, but what if we don’t have any data yet? How can we look at examples or iterate on prompts when we’re just starting out?” That’s what we’ll talk about next."

    "text": "4. Bootstrapping Your AI With Synthetic Data Is Effective (Even With Zero Users)\nOne of the most common roadblocks I hear from teams is: “We can’t do proper evaluation because we don’t have enough real user data yet.” This creates a chicken-and-egg problem – you need data to improve your AI, but you need a decent AI to get users who generate that data.\nFortunately, there’s a solution that works surprisingly well: synthetic data. LLMs can generate realistic test cases that cover the range of scenarios your AI will encounter.\nAs I wrote in my LLM-as-a-Judge blog post, synthetic data can be remarkably effective for evaluation. Bryan Bischof, the former Head of AI at Hex, put it perfectly:\n\n“LLMs are surprisingly good at generating excellent - and diverse - examples of user prompts. This can be relevant for powering application features, and sneakily, for building Evals. If this sounds a bit like the Large Language Snake is eating its tail, I was just as surprised as you! All I can say is: it works, ship it.”\n\n\nA Framework for Generating Realistic Test Data\nThe key to effective synthetic data is choosing the right dimensions to test. While these dimensions will vary based on your specific needs, I find it helpful to think about three broad categories:\n\nFeatures: What capabilities does your AI need to support?\nScenarios: What situations will it encounter?\nUser Personas: Who will be using it and how?\n\nThese aren’t the only dimensions you might care about – you might also want to test different tones of voice, levels of technical sophistication, or even different locales and languages. The important thing is identifying dimensions that matter for your specific use case.\nFor a real estate CRM AI assistant I worked on with Rechat, we defined these dimensions like this:\nfeatures = [\n    \"property search\",      # Finding listings matching criteria\n    \"market analysis\",      # Analyzing trends and pricing\n    \"scheduling\",          # Setting up property viewings\n    \"follow-up\"           # Post-viewing communication\n]\n\nscenarios = [\n    \"exact match\",         # One perfect listing match\n    \"multiple matches\",    # Need to help user narrow down\n    \"no matches\",         # Need to suggest alternatives\n    \"invalid criteria\"     # Help user correct search terms\n]\n\npersonas = [\n    \"first_time_buyer\",    # Needs more guidance and explanation\n    \"investor\",           # Focused on numbers and ROI\n    \"luxury_client\",      # Expects white-glove service\n    \"relocating_family\"   # Has specific neighborhood/school needs\n]\nBut having these dimensions defined is only half the battle. The real challenge is ensuring your synthetic data actually triggers the scenarios you want to test. This requires two things:\n\nA test database with enough variety to support your scenarios\nA way to verify that generated queries actually trigger intended scenarios\n\nFor Rechat, we maintained a test database of listings that we knew would trigger different edge cases. Some teams prefer to use an anonymized copy of production data, but either way, you need to ensure your test data has enough variety to exercise the scenarios you care about.\nHere’s an example of how we might use these dimensions with real data to generate test cases for the property search feature (this is just pseudo-code, and very illustrative):\ndef generate_search_query(scenario, persona, listing_db):\n    \"\"\"Generate a realistic user query about listings\"\"\"\n    # Pull real listing data to ground the generation\n    sample_listings = listing_db.get_sample_listings(\n        price_range=persona.price_range,\n        location=persona.preferred_areas\n    )\n    \n    # Verify we have listings that will trigger our scenario\n    if scenario == \"multiple_matches\" and len(sample_listings) &lt; 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Need multiple listings for this scenario\")\n    if scenario == \"no_matches\" and len(sample_listings) &gt; 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Found matches when testing no-match scenario\")\n    \n    prompt = f\"\"\"\n    You are an expert real estate agent who is searching for listings. You are given a customer type and a scenario.\n    \n    Your job is to generate a natural language query you would use to search these listings.\n    \n    Context:\n    - Customer type: {persona.description}\n    - Scenario: {scenario}\n    \n    Use these actual listings as reference:\n    {format_listings(sample_listings)}\n    \n    The query should reflect the customer type and the scenario.\n\n    Example query: Find homes in the 75019 zip code, 3 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, price range $750k - $1M for an investor.\n    \"\"\"\n    return generate_with_llm(prompt)\nThis produced realistic queries like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nScenario\nPersona\nGenerated Query\n\n\n\n\nproperty search\nmultiple matches\nfirst_time_buyer\n“Looking for 3-bedroom homes under $500k in the Riverside area. Would love something close to parks since we have young kids.”\n\n\nmarket analysis\nno matches\ninvestor\n“Need comps for 123 Oak St. Specifically interested in rental yield comparison with similar properties in a 2-mile radius.”\n\n\n\nThe key to useful synthetic data is grounding it in real system constraints. For the real-estate AI assistant, this means:\n\nUsing real listing IDs and addresses from their database\nIncorporating actual agent schedules and availability windows\nRespecting business rules like showing restrictions and notice periods\nIncluding market-specific details like HOA requirements or local regulations\n\nWe then feed these test cases through Lucy and log the interactions. This gives us a rich dataset to analyze, showing exactly how the AI handles different situations with real system constraints. This approach helped us fix issues before they affected real users.\nSometimes you don’t have access to a production database, especially for new products. In these cases, use LLMs to generate both test queries and the underlying test data. For a real estate AI assistant, this might mean creating synthetic property listings with realistic attributes – prices that match market ranges, valid addresses with real street names, and amenities appropriate for each property type. The key is grounding synthetic data in real-world constraints to make it useful for testing. The specifics of generating robust synthetic databases are beyond the scope of this post.\n\n\nGuidelines for Using Synthetic Data\nWhen generating synthetic data, follow these key principles to ensure it’s effective:\n\nDiversify your dataset: Create examples that cover a wide range of features, scenarios, and personas. As I wrote in my LLM-as-a-Judge post, this diversity helps you identify edge cases and failure modes you might not anticipate otherwise.\nGenerate user inputs, not outputs: Use LLMs to generate realistic user queries or inputs, not the expected AI responses. This prevents your synthetic data from inheriting the biases or limitations of the generating model.\nIncorporate real system constraints: Ground your synthetic data in actual system limitations and data. For example, when testing a scheduling feature, use real availability windows and booking rules.\nVerify scenario coverage: Ensure your generated data actually triggers the scenarios you want to test. A query intended to test “no matches found” should actually return zero results when run against your system.\nStart simple, then add complexity: Begin with straightforward test cases before adding nuance. This helps isolate issues and establish a baseline before tackling edge cases.\n\nThis approach isn’t just theoretical – it’s been proven in production across dozens of companies. What often starts as a stopgap measure becomes a permanent part of the evaluation infrastructure, even after real user data becomes available.\nLet’s look at how to maintain trust in your evaluation system as you scale…"

    "text": "5. Maintaining Trust In Evals Is Critical\nThis is a pattern I’ve seen repeatedly: teams build evaluation systems, then gradually lose faith in them. Sometimes it’s because the metrics don’t align with what they observe in production. Other times, it’s because the evaluations become too complex to interpret. Either way, the result is the same – the team reverts to making decisions based on gut feeling and anecdotal feedback, undermining the entire purpose of having evaluations.\nMaintaining trust in your evaluation system is just as important as building it in the first place. Here’s how the most successful teams approach this challenge:\n\nUnderstanding Criteria Drift\nOne of the most insidious problems in AI evaluation is “criteria drift” – a phenomenon where evaluation criteria evolve as you observe more model outputs. In their paper “Who Validates the Validators?”, Shankar et al. describe this phenomenon:\n\n“To grade outputs, people need to externalize and define their evaluation criteria; however, the process of grading outputs helps them to define that very criteria.”\n\nThis creates a paradox: you can’t fully define your evaluation criteria until you’ve seen a wide range of outputs, but you need criteria to evaluate those outputs in the first place. In other words, it is impossible to completely determine evaluation criteria prior to human judging of LLM outputs.\nI’ve observed this firsthand when working with Phillip Carter at Honeycomb on their Query Assistant feature. As we evaluated the AI’s ability to generate database queries, Phillip noticed something interesting:\n\n“Seeing how the LLM breaks down its reasoning made me realize I wasn’t being consistent about how I judged certain edge cases.”\n\nThe process of reviewing AI outputs helped him articulate his own evaluation standards more clearly. This isn’t a sign of poor planning – it’s an inherent characteristic of working with AI systems that produce diverse and sometimes unexpected outputs.\nThe teams that maintain trust in their evaluation systems embrace this reality rather than fighting it. They treat evaluation criteria as living documents that evolve alongside their understanding of the problem space. They also recognize that different stakeholders might have different (sometimes contradictory) criteria, and they work to reconcile these perspectives rather than imposing a single standard.\n\n\nCreating Trustworthy Evaluation Systems\nSo how do you build evaluation systems that remain trustworthy despite criteria drift? Here are the approaches I’ve found most effective:\n\n1. Favor Binary Decisions Over Arbitrary Scales\nAs I wrote in my LLM-as-a-Judge post, binary decisions provide clarity that more complex scales often obscure. When faced with a 1-5 scale, evaluators frequently struggle with the difference between a 3 and a 4, introducing inconsistency and subjectivity. What exactly distinguishes “somewhat helpful” from “helpful”? These boundary cases consume disproportionate mental energy and create noise in your evaluation data. And even when businesses use a 1-5 scale, they inevitably ask where to draw the line for “good enough” or to trigger intervention, forcing a binary decision anyway.\nIn contrast, a binary pass/fail forces evaluators to make a clear judgment: did this output achieve its purpose or not? This clarity extends to measuring progress – a 10% increase in passing outputs is immediately meaningful, while a 0.5-point improvement on a 5-point scale requires interpretation.\nI’ve found that teams who resist binary evaluation often do so because they want to capture nuance. But nuance isn’t lost – it’s just moved to the qualitative critique that accompanies the judgment. The critique provides rich context about why something passed or failed, and what specific aspects could be improved, while the binary decision creates actionable clarity about whether improvement is needed at all.\n\n\n2. Enhance Binary Judgments With Detailed Critiques\nWhile binary decisions provide clarity, they work best when paired with detailed critiques that capture the nuance of why something passed or failed. This combination gives you the best of both worlds: clear, actionable metrics and rich contextual understanding.\nFor example, when evaluating a response that correctly answers a user’s question but contains unnecessary information, a good critique might read:\n\n“The AI successfully provided the market analysis requested (PASS), but included excessive detail about neighborhood demographics that wasn’t relevant to the investment question. This makes the response longer than necessary and potentially distracting.”\n\nThese critiques serve multiple functions beyond just explanation. They force domain experts to externalize implicit knowledge – I’ve seen legal experts move from vague feelings that something “doesn’t sound right” to articulating specific issues with citation formats or reasoning patterns that can be systematically addressed.\nWhen included as few-shot examples in judge prompts, these critiques improve the LLM’s ability to reason about complex edge cases. I’ve found this approach often yields 15-20% higher agreement rates between human and LLM evaluations compared to prompts without example critiques. The critiques also provide excellent raw material for generating high-quality synthetic data, creating a flywheel for improvement.\n\n\n3. Measure Alignment Between Automated Evals and Human Judgment\nIf you’re using LLMs to evaluate outputs (which is often necessary at scale), it’s crucial to regularly check how well these automated evaluations align with human judgment.\nThis is particularly important given our natural tendency to over-trust AI systems. As Shankar et al. note in “Who Validates the Validators?”, the lack of tools to validate evaluator quality is concerning\n\nResearch shows people tend to over-rely and over-trust AI systems. For instance, in one high profile incident, researchers from MIT posted a pre-print on arXiv claiming that GPT-4 could ace the MIT EECS exam. Within hours, [the] work [was] debunked … citing problems arising from over-reliance on GPT-4 to grade itself.”\n\nThis over-trust problem extends beyond self-evaluation. Research has shown that LLMs can be biased by simple factors like the ordering of options in a set, or even seemingly innocuous formatting changes in prompts. Without rigorous human validation, these biases can silently undermine your evaluation system.\nWhen working with Honeycomb, we tracked agreement rates between our LLM-as-a-judge and Phillip’s evaluations:\n\n\n\nAgreement rates between LLM evaluator and human expert. More details here.\n\n\nIt took three iterations to achieve &gt;90% agreement, but this investment paid off in a system the team could trust. Without this validation step, automated evaluations often drift from human expectations over time, especially as the distribution of inputs changes. You can read more about this here.\nTools like Eugene Yan’s AlignEval demonstrate this alignment process beautifully. It provides a simple interface where you upload data, label examples with a binary “good” or “bad,” and then evaluate LLM-based judges against those human judgments. What makes it effective is how it streamlines the workflow – you can quickly see where automated evaluations diverge from your preferences, refine your criteria based on these insights, and measure improvement over time. This approach reinforces that alignment isn’t a one-time setup but an ongoing conversation between human judgment and automated evaluation.\n\n\n\nScaling Without Losing Trust\nAs your AI system grows, you’ll inevitably face pressure to reduce the human effort involved in evaluation. This is where many teams go wrong – they automate too much, too quickly, and lose the human connection that keeps their evaluations grounded.\nThe most successful teams take a more measured approach:\n\nStart with high human involvement: In the early stages, have domain experts evaluate a significant percentage of outputs.\nStudy alignment patterns: Rather than automating evaluation, focus on understanding where automated evaluations align with human judgment and where they diverge. This helps you identify which types of cases need more careful human attention.\nUse strategic sampling: Rather than evaluating every output, use statistical techniques to sample outputs that provide the most information, particularly focusing on areas where alignment is weakest.\nMaintain regular calibration: Even as you scale, continue to compare automated evaluations against human judgment regularly, using these comparisons to refine your understanding of when to trust automated evaluations.\n\nScaling evaluation isn’t just about reducing human effort – it’s about directing that effort where it adds the most value. By focusing human attention on the most challenging or informative cases, you can maintain quality even as your system grows.\nNow that we’ve covered how to maintain trust in your evaluations, let’s talk about a fundamental shift in how you should approach AI development roadmaps…"

    "text": "6. Your AI Roadmap Should Count Experiments, Not Features\nIf you’ve worked in software development, you’re familiar with traditional roadmaps: a list of features with target delivery dates. Teams commit to shipping specific functionality by specific deadlines, and success is measured by how closely they hit those targets.\nThis approach fails spectacularly with AI.\nI’ve watched teams commit to roadmaps like “Launch sentiment analysis by Q2” or “Deploy agent-based customer support by end of year,” only to discover that the technology simply isn’t ready to meet their quality bar. They either ship something subpar to hit the deadline or miss the deadline entirely. Either way, trust erodes.\nThe fundamental problem is that traditional roadmaps assume we know what’s possible. With conventional software, that’s often true – given enough time and resources, you can build most features reliably. With AI, especially at the cutting edge, you’re constantly testing the boundaries of what’s feasible.\n\nExperiments vs. Features\nBryan Bischof, Former Head of AI at Hex, introduced me to what he calls a “capability funnel” approach to AI roadmaps. This strategy reframes how we think about AI development progress.\nInstead of defining success as shipping a feature, the capability funnel breaks down AI performance into progressive levels of utility. At the top of the funnel is the most basic functionality – can the system respond at all? At the bottom is fully solving the user’s job to be done. Between these points are various stages of increasing usefulness.\nFor example, in a query assistant, the capability funnel might look like: 1. Can generate syntactically valid queries (basic functionality) 2. Can generate queries that execute without errors 3. Can generate queries that return relevant results 4. Can generate queries that match user intent 5. Can generate optimal queries that solve the user’s problem (complete solution)\nThis approach acknowledges that AI progress isn’t binary – it’s about gradually improving capabilities across multiple dimensions. It also provides a framework for measuring progress even when you haven’t reached the final goal.\nThe most successful teams I’ve worked with structure their roadmaps around experiments rather than features. Instead of committing to specific outcomes, they commit to a cadence of experimentation, learning, and iteration.\nEugene Yan, an applied scientist at Amazon, shared how he approaches ML project planning with leadership - a process that, while originally developed for traditional machine learning, applies equally well to modern LLM development:\n\n“Here’s a common timeline. First, I take two weeks to do a data feasibility analysis, i.e”do I have the right data?” […] Then I take an additional month to do a technical feasibility analysis, i.e “can AI solve this?” After that, if it still works I’ll spend six weeks building a prototype we can A/B test.”\n\nWhile LLMs might not require the same kind of feature engineering or model training as traditional ML, the underlying principle remains the same: time-box your exploration, establish clear decision points, and focus on proving feasibility before committing to full implementation. This approach gives leadership confidence that resources won’t be wasted on open-ended exploration, while giving the team the freedom to learn and adapt as they go.\n\n\nThe Foundation: Evaluation Infrastructure\nThe key to making an experiment-based roadmap work is having robust evaluation infrastructure. Without it, you’re just guessing whether your experiments are working. With it, you can rapidly iterate, test hypotheses, and build on successes.\nI saw this firsthand during the early development of GitHub Copilot. What most people don’t realize is that the team invested heavily in building sophisticated offline evaluation infrastructure. They created systems that could test code completions against a very large corpus of repositories on GitHub, leveraging unit tests that already existed in high-quality codebases as an automated way to verify completion correctness. This was a massive engineering undertaking – they had to build systems that could clone repositories at scale, set up their environments, run their test suites, and analyze the results, all while handling the incredible diversity of programming languages, frameworks, and testing approaches.\nThis wasn’t wasted time—it was the foundation that accelerated everything. With solid evaluation in place, the team ran thousands of experiments, quickly identified what worked, and could say with confidence “this change improved quality by X%” instead of relying on gut feelings. While the upfront investment in evaluation feels slow, it prevents endless debates about whether changes help or hurt, and dramatically speeds up innovation later.\n\n\nCommunicating This to Stakeholders\nThe challenge, of course, is that executives often want certainty. They want to know when features will ship and what they’ll do. How do you bridge this gap?\nThe key is to shift the conversation from outputs to outcomes. Instead of promising specific features by specific dates, commit to a process that will maximize the chances of achieving the desired business outcomes.\nEugene shared how he handles these conversations:\n\n“I try to reassure leadership with timeboxes. At the end of three months, if it works out, then we move it to production. At any step of the way, if it doesn’t work out, we pivot.”\n\nThis approach gives stakeholders clear decision points while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in AI development. It also helps manage expectations about timelines – instead of promising a feature in six months, you’re promising a clear understanding of whether that feature is feasible in three months.\nBryan’s capability funnel approach provides another powerful communication tool. It allows teams to show concrete progress through the funnel stages, even when the final solution isn’t ready. It also helps executives understand where problems are occurring and make informed decisions about where to invest resources.\n\n\nBuild a Culture of Experimentation Through Failure Sharing\nPerhaps the most counterintuitive aspect of this approach is the emphasis on learning from failures. In traditional software development, failures are often hidden or downplayed. In AI development, they’re the primary source of learning.\nEugene operationalizes this at his organization through what he calls a “fifteen-five” – a weekly update that takes fifteen minutes to write and five minutes to read:\n\n“In my fifteen-fives, I document my failures and my successes. Within our team, we also have weekly”no-prep sharing sessions” where we discuss what we’ve been working on and what we’ve learned. When I do this, I go out of my way to share failures.”\n\nThis practice normalizes failure as part of the learning process. It shows that even experienced practitioners encounter dead ends, and it accelerates team learning by sharing those experiences openly. And by celebrating the process of experimentation rather than just the outcomes, teams create an environment where people feel safe taking risks and learning from failures.\n\n\nA Better Way Forward\nSo what does an experiment-based roadmap look like in practice? Here’s a simplified example from a content moderation project Eugene worked on:\n\n“I was asked to do content moderation. I said, ‘It’s uncertain whether we’ll meet that goal. It’s uncertain even if that goal is feasible with our data, or what machine learning techniques would work. But here’s my experimentation roadmap. Here are the techniques I’m gonna try, and I’m gonna update you at a two-week cadence.’”\n\nThe roadmap didn’t promise specific features or capabilities. Instead, it committed to a systematic exploration of possible approaches, with regular check-ins to assess progress and pivot if necessary.\nThe results were telling:\n\n“For the first two to three months, nothing worked. […] And then [a breakthrough] came out. […] Within a month, that problem was solved. So you can see that in the first quarter or even four months, it was going nowhere. […] But then you can also see that all of a sudden, some new technology comes along, some new paradigm, some new reframing comes along that just [solves] 80% of [the problem].”\n\nThis pattern – long periods of apparent failure followed by breakthroughs – is common in AI development. Traditional feature-based roadmaps would have killed the project after months of “failure,” missing the eventual breakthrough.\nBy focusing on experiments rather than features, teams create space for these breakthroughs to emerge. They also build the infrastructure and processes that make breakthroughs more likely – data pipelines, evaluation frameworks, and rapid iteration cycles.\nThe most successful teams I’ve worked with start by building evaluation infrastructure before committing to specific features. They create tools that make iteration faster and focus on processes that support rapid experimentation. This approach might seem slower at first, but it dramatically accelerates development in the long run by enabling teams to learn and adapt quickly.\nThe key metric for AI roadmaps isn’t features shipped – it’s experiments run. The teams that win are those that can run more experiments, learn faster, and iterate more quickly than their competitors. And the foundation for this rapid experimentation is always the same: robust, trusted evaluation infrastructure that gives everyone confidence in the results.\nBy reframing your roadmap around experiments rather than features, you create the conditions for similar breakthroughs in your own organization."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThroughout this post, I’ve shared patterns I’ve observed across dozens of AI implementations. The most successful teams aren’t the ones with the most sophisticated tools or the most advanced models – they’re the ones that master the fundamentals of measurement, iteration, and learning.\nThe core principles are surprisingly simple:\n\nLook at your data. Nothing replaces the insight gained from examining real examples. Error analysis consistently reveals the highest-ROI improvements.\nBuild simple tools that remove friction. Custom data viewers that make it easy to examine AI outputs yield more insights than complex dashboards with generic metrics.\nEmpower domain experts. The people who understand your domain best are often the ones who can most effectively improve your AI, regardless of their technical background.\nUse synthetic data strategically. You don’t need real users to start testing and improving your AI. Thoughtfully generated synthetic data can bootstrap your evaluation process.\nMaintain trust in your evaluations. Binary judgments with detailed critiques create clarity while preserving nuance. Regular alignment checks ensure automated evaluations remain trustworthy.\nStructure roadmaps around experiments, not features. Commit to a cadence of experimentation and learning rather than specific outcomes by specific dates.\n\nThese principles apply regardless of your domain, team size, or technical stack. They’ve worked for companies ranging from early-stage startups to tech giants, across use cases from customer support to code generation.\n\nResources for Going Deeper\nIf you’d like to explore these topics further, here are some resources that might help:\n\nMy blog for more content on AI evaluation and improvement.

    "title": "Your AI Product Needs Evals",
    "section": "Level 1: Unit Tests",
    "text": "Level 1: Unit Tests\nUnit tests for LLMs are assertions (like you would write in pytest). Unlike typical unit tests, you want to organize these assertions for use in places beyond unit tests, such as data cleaning and automatic retries (using the assertion error to course-correct) during model inference. The important part is that these assertions should run fast and cheaply as you develop your application so that you can run them every time your code changes. If you have trouble thinking of assertions, you should critically examine your traces and failure modes. Also, do not shy away from using an LLM to help you brainstorm assertions!\n\nStep 1: Write Scoped Tests\nThe most effective way to think about unit tests is to break down the scope of your LLM into features and scenarios. For example, one feature of Lucy is the ability to find real estate listings, which we can break down into scenarios like so:\nFeature: Listing Finder\nThis feature to be tested is a function call that responds to a user request to find a real estate listing. For example, “Please find listings with more than 3 bedrooms less than $2M in San Jose, CA”\nThe LLM converts this into a query that gets run against the CRM. The assertion then verifies that the expected number of results is returned. In our test suite, we have three user inputs that trigger each of the scenarios below, which then execute corresponding assertions (this is an oversimplified example for illustrative purposes):\n\n\n\nScenario\nAssertions\n\n\n\n\nOnly one listing matches user query\nlen(listing_array) == 1\n\n\nMultiple listings match user query\nlen(listing_array) &gt; 1\n\n\nNo listings match user query\nlen(listing_array) == 0\n\n\n\n There are also generic tests that aren’t specific to any one feature. For example, here is the code for one such generic test that ensures the UUID is not mentioned in the output:\nconst noExposedUUID = message =&gt; {\n  // Remove all text within double curly braces\n  const sanitizedComment = message.comment.replace(/\\{\\{.*?\\}\\}/g, '')\n\n  // Search for exposed UUIDs\n  const regexp = /[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{12}/ig\n  const matches = Array.from(sanitizedComment.matchAll(regexp))\n  expect(matches.length, 'Exposed UUIDs').to.equal(0, 'Exposed UUIDs found')\n}\n\nCRM results returned to the LLM contain fields that shouldn’t be surfaced to the user; such as the UUID associated with an entry. Our LLM prompt tells the LLM to not include UUIDs. We use a simple regex to assert that the LLM response doesn’t include UUIDs.\n\nRechat has hundreds of these unit tests. We continuously update them based on new failures we observe in the data as users challenge the AI or the product evolves. These unit tests are crucial to getting feedback quickly when iterating on your AI system (prompt engineering, improving RAG, etc.). Many people eventually outgrow their unit tests and move on to other levels of evaluation as their product matures, but it is essential not to skip this step!\n\n\nStep 2: Create Test Cases\nTo test these assertions, you must generate test cases or inputs that will trigger all scenarios you wish to test. I often utilize an LLM to generate these inputs synthetically; for example, here is one such prompt Rechat uses to generate synthetic inputs for a feature that creates and retrieves contacts:\nWrite 50 different instructions that a real estate agent can give to his assistant to create contacts on his CRM. The contact details can include name, phone, email, partner name, birthday, tags, company, address and job.\n\nFor each of the instructions, you need to generate a second instruction which can be used to look up the created contact.\n\n. The results should be a JSON code block with only one string as the instruction like the following:\n\n\n[\n  [\"Create a contact for John (johndoe@apple.com)\", \n  \"What's the email address of John Smith?\"]\n]\nUsing the above prompt, we generate test cases like below:\n[ \n    [\n        'Create a contact for John Smith (johndoe@apple.com) with phone number 123-456-7890 and address 123 Apple St.', \n        'What\\'s the email address of John Smith?'\n    ],\n    [\n        'Add Emily Johnson with phone 987-654-3210, email emilyj@email.com, and company ABC Inc.', \n        'What\\'s the phone number for Emily Johnson?'\n    ],\n    [\n        'Create a contact for Tom Williams with birthday 10/20/1985, company XYZ Ltd, and job title Manager.', \n        'What\\'s Tom Williams\\' job title?'\n    ],\n    [\n        'Add a contact for Susan Brown with partner name James Brown, and email susanb@email.com.', \n    'What\\'s the partner name of Susan Brown?'\n    ],\n…\n]\nFor each of these test cases, we execute the first user input to create the contact. We then execute the second query to fetch that contact. If the CRM doesn’t return exactly 1 result then we know there was a problem either creating or fetching the contact. We can also run generic assertions like the one to verify UUIDs are not in the response. You must constantly update these tests as you observe data through human evaluation and debugging. The key is to make these as challenging as possible while representing users’ interactions with the system.\nYou don’t need to wait for production data to test your system. You can make educated guesses about how users will use your product and generate synthetic data. You can also let a small set of users use your product and let their usage refine your synthetic data generation strategy. One signal you are writing good tests and assertions is when the model struggles to pass them - these failure modes become problems you can solve with techniques like fine-tuning later on.\nOn a related note, unlike traditional unit tests, you don’t necessarily need a 100% pass rate. Your pass rate is a product decision, depending on the failures you are willing to tolerate.\n\n\nStep 3: Run & Track Your Tests Regularly\nThere are many ways to orchestrate Level 1 tests. Rechat has been leveraging CI infrastructure (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab Pipelines, etc.) to execute these tests. However, the tooling for this part of the workflow is nascent and evolving rapidly.\nMy advice is to orchestrate tests that involve the least friction in your tech stack. In addition to tracking tests, you need to track the results of your tests over time so you can see if you are making progress. If you use CI, you should collect metrics along with versions of your tests/prompts outside your CI system for easy analysis and tracking.\nI recommend starting simple and leveraging your existing analytics system to visualize your test results. For example, Rechat uses Metabase to track their LLM test results over time. Below is a screenshot of a dashboard Rechat built with Metabase:\n\nThis screenshot shows the prevalence of a particular error (shown in yellow) in Lucy before (left) vs after (right) we addressed it."

    "section": "Level 2: Human & Model Eval",
    "text": "Level 2: Human & Model Eval\nAfter you have built a solid foundation of Level 1 tests, you can move on to other forms of validation that cannot be tested by assertions alone. A prerequisite to performing human and model-based eval is to log your traces.\n\nLogging Traces\nA trace is a concept that has been around for a while in software engineering and is a log of a sequence of events such as user sessions or a request flow through a distributed system. In other words, tracing is a logical grouping of logs. In the context of LLMs, traces often refer to conversations you have with a LLM. For example, a user message, followed by an AI response, followed by another user message, would be an example of a trace.\nThere are a growing number of solutions for logging LLM traces.2 Rechat uses LangSmith, which logs traces and allows you to view them in a human-readable way with an interactive playground to iterate on prompts. Sometimes, logging your traces requires you to instrument your code. In this case, Rechat was using LangChain which automatically logs trace events to LangSmith for you. Here is a screenshot of what this looks like:\n\nI like LangSmith - it doesn’t require that you use LangChain and is intuitive and easy to use. Searching, filtering, and reading traces are essential features for whatever solution you pick. I’ve found that some tools do not implement these basic functions correctly!\n\n\nLooking At Your Traces\nYou must remove all friction from the process of looking at data. This means rendering your traces in domain-specific ways. I’ve often found that it’s better to build my own data viewing & labeling tool so I can gather all the information I need onto one screen. In Lucy’s case, we needed to look at many sources of information (trace log, the CRM, etc) to understand what the AI did. This is precisely the type of friction that needs to be eliminated. In Rechat’s case, this meant adding information like:\n\nWhat tool (feature) & scenario was being evaluated.\nWhether the trace resulted from a synthetic input or a real user input.\nFilters to navigate between different tools and scenario combinations.\nLinks to the CRM and trace logging system for the current record.\n\nI’ve built different variations of this tool for each problem I’ve worked on. Sometimes, I even need to embed another application to see what the user interaction looks like. Below is a screenshot of the tool we built to evaluate Rechat’s traces:\n\nAnother design choice specific to Lucy is that we noticed that many failures involved small mistakes in the final output of the LLM (format, content, etc). We decided to make the final output editable by a human so that we could curate & fix data for fine-tuning.\nThese tools can be built with lightweight front-end frameworks like Gradio, Streamlit, Panel, or Shiny in less than a day. The tool shown above was built with Shiny for Python. Furthermore, there are tools like Lilac which uses AI to search and filter data semantically, which is incredibly handy for finding a set of similar data points while debugging an issue.\nI often start by labeling examples as good or bad. I’ve found that assigning scores or more granular ratings is more onerous to manage than binary ratings. There are advanced techniques you can use to make human evaluation more efficient or accurate (e.g., active learning, consensus voting, etc.), but I recommend starting with something simple. Finally, like unit tests, you should organize and analyze your human-eval results to assess if you are progressing over time.\nAs discussed later, these labeled examples measure the quality of your system, validate automated evaluation, and curate high-quality synthetic data for fine-tuning.\n\nHow much data should you look at?\nI often get asked how much data to examine. When starting, you should examine as much data as possible. I usually read traces generated from ALL test cases and user-generated traces at a minimum. You can never stop looking at data—no free lunch exists. However, you can sample your data more over time, lessening the burden. 3\n\n\n\nAutomated Evaluation w/ LLMs\nMany vendors want to sell you tools that claim to eliminate the need for a human to look at the data. Having humans periodically evaluate at least a sample of traces is a good idea. I often find that “correctness” is somewhat subjective, and you must align the model with a human.\nYou should track the correlation between model-based and human evaluation to decide how much you can rely on automatic evaluation. Furthermore, by collecting critiques from labelers explaining why they are making a decision, you can iterate on the evaluator model to align it with humans through prompt engineering or fine-tuning. However, I tend to favor prompt engineering for evaluator model alignment.\nI love using low-tech solutions like Excel to iterate on aligning model-based eval with humans. For example, I sent my colleague Phillip the following spreadsheet every few days to grade for a different use-case involving a natural language query generator. This spreadsheet would contain the following information:\n\nmodel response: this is the prediction made by the LLM.\nmodel critique: this is a critique written by a (usually more powerful) LLM about your original LLM’s prediction.\nmodel outcome: this is a binary label the critique model assigns to the model response as being “good” or “bad.”\n\nPhillip then fills out his version of the same information - meaning his critique, outcome, and desired response for 25-50 examples at a time (these are the columns prefixed with “phillip_” below):\n\nThis information allowed me to iterate on the prompt of the critique model to make it sufficiently aligned with Phillip over time. This is also easy to track in a low-tech way in a spreadsheet:\n\nThis is a screenshot of a spreadsheet where we recorded our attempts to align model-based eval with a human evaluator.\nGeneral tips on model-based eval:\n\nUse the most powerful model you can afford. It often takes advanced reasoning capabilities to critique something well. You can often get away with a slower, more powerful model for critiquing outputs relative to what you use in production.\nModel-based evaluation is a meta-problem within your larger problem. You must maintain a mini-evaluation system to track its quality. I have sometimes fine-tuned a model at this stage (but I try not to).\nAfter bringing the model-based evaluator in line with the human, you must continue doing periodic exercises to monitor the model and human agreement.\n\nMy favorite aspect about creating a good evaluator model is that its critiques can be used to curate high-quality synthetic data, which I will touch upon later."

    "text": "Fine-Tuning\nRechat resolved many failure modes through fine-tuning that were not possible with prompt engineering alone. Fine-tuning is best for learning syntax, style, and rules, whereas techniques like RAG supply the model with context or up-to-date facts.\n99% of the labor involved with fine-tuning is assembling high-quality data that covers your AI product’s surface area. However, if you have a solid evaluation system like Rechat’s, you already have a robust data generation and curation engine! I will expand more on the process of fine-tuning in a future post.4\n\nData Synthesis & Curation\nTo illustrate why data curation and synthesis come nearly for free once you have an evaluation system, consider the case where you want to create additional fine-tuning data for the listing finder mentioned earlier. First, you can use LLMs to generate synthetic data with a prompt like this:\nImagine if Zillow was able to parse natural language. Come up with 50 different ways users would be able to search listings there. Use real names for cities and neighborhoods.\n\nYou can use the following parameters:\n\n&lt;ommitted for confidentiality&gt;\n\nOutput should be a JSON code block array. Example:\n\n[\n\"Homes under $500k in New York\"\n]\nThis is almost identical to the exercise for producing test cases! You can then use your Level 1 & Level 2 tests to filter out undesirable data that fails assertions or that the critique model thinks are wrong. You can also use your existing human evaluation tools to look at traces to curate traces for a fine-tuning dataset."

    "text": "Here is my personal opinion about the questions I posed in this tweet:\n\n\nThere are a growing number of voices expressing disillusionment with fine-tuning. I'm curious about the sentiment more generally. (I am withholding sharing my opinion rn). Tweets below are from @mlpowered @abacaj @emollick pic.twitter.com/cU0hCdubBU\n\n— Hamel Husain (@HamelHusain) March 26, 2024\n\n\n\nI think that fine-tuning is still very valuable in many situations. I’ve done some more digging and I find that people who say that fine-tuning isn’t useful are indeed often working on products where fine-tuning isn’t likely to be useful:\n\nThey are making developer tools - foundation models have been trained extensively on coding tasks.\nThey are building foundation models and testing for the most general cases. But the foundation models themselves are also being trained for the most general cases.\nThey are building a personal assistant that isn’t scoped to any type of domain or use case and is essentially similar to the same folks building foundation models.\n\nAnother common pattern is that people often say this in earlier stages of their product development. One sign that folks are in really early stages is that they don’t have a domain-specific eval harness.\nIt’s impossible to fine-tune effectively without an eval system which can lead to writing off fine-tuning if you haven’t completed this prerequisite. It’s also impossible to improve your product without a good eval system in the long term, fine-tuning or not.\nYou should do as much prompt engineering as possible before you fine-tune. But not for reasons you would think! The reason for doing lots of prompt engineering is that it’s a great way to stress test your eval system!\nIf you find that prompt-engineering works fine (and you are systematically evaluating your product) then it’s fine to stop there. I’m a big believer in using the simplest approach to solving a problem. I just don’t think you should write off fine-tuning yet.\n\nExamples where I’ve seen fine-tuning work well\nGenerally speaking, fine-tuning works best to learn syntax, style and rules whereas techniques like RAG work best to supply the model with context or up-to-date facts.\nThese are some examples from companies I’ve worked with. Hopefully, we will be able to share more details soon.\n\nHoneycomb’s Natural Language Query Assistant - previously, the “programming manual” for the Honeycomb query language was being dumped into the prompt along with many examples. While this was OK, fine-tuning worked much better to allow the model to learn the syntax and rules of this niche domain-specific language.\nReChat’s Lucy - this is an AI real estate assistant integrated into an existing Real Estate CRM system. ReChat needs LLM responses to be provided in a very idiosyncratic format that weaves together structured and unstructured data to allow the front end to render widgets, cards and other interactive elements dynamically into the chat interface. Fine-tuning was the key to making this work correctly. This talk has more details.\n\nP.S. Fine-tuning is not only limited to open or “small” models. There are lots of folks who have been fine-tuning GPT-3.5, such as Perplexity.AI: and CaseText, to name a few."

    "section": "Q: Is RAG dead?",
    "text": "Q: Is RAG dead?\nQuestion: Should I avoid using RAG for my AI application after reading that “RAG is dead” for coding agents?\n\nMany developers are confused about when and how to use RAG after reading articles claiming “RAG is dead.” Understanding what RAG actually means versus the narrow marketing definitions will help you make better architectural decisions for your AI applications.\n\nThe viral article claiming RAG is dead specifically argues against using naive vector database retrieval for autonomous coding agents, not RAG as a whole. This is a crucial distinction that many developers miss due to misleading marketing.\nRAG simply means Retrieval-Augmented Generation - using retrieval to provide relevant context that improves your model’s output. The core principle remains essential: your LLM needs the right context to generate accurate answers. The question isn’t whether to use retrieval, but how to retrieve effectively.\nFor coding applications, naive vector similarity search often fails because code relationships are complex and contextual. Instead of abandoning retrieval entirely, modern coding assistants like Claude Code still uses retrieval —they just employ agentic search instead of relying solely on vector databases.similar to how human developers work.\nYou have multiple retrieval strategies available, ranging from simple keyword matching to embedding similarity to LLM-powered relevance filtering. The optimal approach depends on your specific use case, data characteristics, and performance requirements. Many production systems combine multiple strategies or use multi-hop retrieval guided by LLM agents.\nUnforunately, “RAG” has become a buzzword with no shared definition. Some people use it to mean any retrieval system, others restrict it to vector databases. Focus on the fundamental goal: getting your LLM the context it needs to succeed. Whether that’s through vector search, agentic exploration, or hybrid approaches is a product and engineering decision that requires understanding your users’ failure modes and usage patterns.\nRather than following categorical advice to avoid or embrace RAG, experiment with different retrieval approaches and measure what works best for your application."

The judge is doing a narrowly scoped binary classification task. So actually you don’t have to worry about the judge not being able to do the main task…since it doesn’t have to. Focus on achieving high TPR and TNR with your judge rather than avoiding the same model family.\nWhen selecting judge models, start with the most capable models available to establish strong alignment with human judgments. Start with the most powerful LLMs for your judge models and work on aligning them with human annotators. You can optimize for cost later once you’ve established reliable evaluation criteria."

A lot of real-life experiences and tips you can’t find anywhere on the web packed into this amazing course/workshop/conference! Thanks Dan and Hamel for making this happen!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarcus, Software Engineer\n\nThe Mastering LLMs conference answered several key questions I had about when to fine-tune base models, building evaluation suits and when to use RAG. The sessions provided a valuable overview of the technical challenges and considerations involved in building and deploying custom LLMs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAli, Principal & Founder, SCTY\n\nThe course that became a conference, filled with a lineup of renowned practitioners whose expertise (and contributions to the field) was only exceeded by their generosity of spirit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLukas, Software Engineer\n\nThe sheer amount of diverse speakers that cover the same topics from different approaches, both praising and/or degrading certain workflows makes this extremely valuable. Especially when a lot of information online, is produced by those, who are building a commercial product behind, naturally is biased towards a fine tune, a RAG, an open source LLM, an open ai LLM etc. It is rather extra ordinary to have a variety of opinions packed like this.

    "text": "Kubernetes, known as K8s, is an open-source system for deploying and managing containerized applications in the cloud. An increasing amount of modern web applications are deployed on K8s. If you are an ML engineer, it is increasingly likely that either the infrastructure you use to train, monitor, or orchestrate your models is deployed on K8s, or downstream applications that consume your models are running on K8s. However, K8s is a complex system that can be intimidating to learn.\nI agree with Chip Huyen that, in theory, Data Scientists shouldn’t need to learn K8s. However, the truth is: Even though you shouldn’t have to, it’s really beneficial if you do! I’ve found that I’m often constrained by infrastructure and that infrastructure is increasingly hosted on Kubernetes.\nFor example, I’m rarely given access to a cloud provider’s console, and instead, I have access to a K8s cluster with some data tools already installed. When something goes awry, it’s beneficial to know enough about K8s to debug the issue. Additionally, familiarity with basic concepts allows me to have more productive conversations with my team about infrastructure.\nVicki Boykis seems to agree that the investment in learning this technology is worthwhile1:\nBelow, I outline several reasons why learning K8s is a good idea for machine learning engineers2."

For example, I’ve seen the following tools deployed alongside or in place of hosted solutions:\n\nMetaflow\nKubeflow\nArgo\nJupyterHub\nDask\netc.\n\nWhen open source isn’t enough, third-party vendors are happy to install their software on your cloud. However, you often need basic infrastructure skills to enable this. These skills often intersect with Kubernetes. While you may not be responsible for deploying the infrastructure yourself, it is helpful to understand the basics of how things work so that you can do basic debugging and troubleshooting. For example, knowing where to find logs or an API/HTTPS endpoint can unblock you in many cases."

This is incredibly frustrating, as making progress without the proper tools can be hard. This experience usually culminates in a conversation like this:\n\nML Eng: I’m excited to join ACME company! You’ve hired me to optimize marketing spending with predictive models. The issue is that we don’t have the basic infrastructure or tools necessary for me to work efficiently.\nManager: I’m confused. Can’t you install the tools you need? Isn’t that what you are for? I was expecting that you would figure it out.\nML Eng: No, I don’t know how to set up and deploy infrastructure. We need a special infrastructure or DevOps person for that.\nManager: It will be hard to ask for more resources if we don’t know the expected return on investment. Can you do the ML project first, demonstrate some value, and then we can invest in infrastructure?\nML Eng: I need some minimum tools to experiment more quickly and develop a proof of concept. Also, I need tools that might help me collaborate better with my team…\n\nMy experience is that DevOps teams are chronically understaffed and overworked. While it usually isn’t advisable to deploy enterprise software yourself on Kubernetes for security concerns, having basic skills can lift a tremendous burden off your DevOps counterparts and make it tractable for them to help you.\nK8s are not a panacea for all infrastructure problems.

For example, hosting your data product on a single VM is often insufficient if you want to deploy production software. Many companies even have infrastructure that may block you from doing this with paved paths that only include Kubernetes.\nEven if you are not deploying any production software, K8s can be invaluable in allowing you to deploy the tools you need.

For example:\n\nTraining data from two different fine-tuning runs\nTraining data vs. evaluation data\nTraining data vs. production data (organized into the same format)\nData from two different time-periods\n\nCreate features from the dataset. A basic example that creates features from tokens is illustrated here.3\nGive dataset #1 a label of 0 and dataset #2 a label of 1.\nFit a binary classifier (random forest, logistic regression, etc) to discriminate between the two datasets.\nIf the classifier demonstrates sufficient predictive power (ex: AUC &gt;=0.60), we know there is drift.\nIf you used an interpretable model (like logistic regression, random forest, etc.), you can inspect feature importance metrics to understand the root cause of the drift. If you use a more complex model (like a neural network), you can use SHAP values or other methods to understand what is causing the drift. I recommend starting with a simple interpretable model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf this process doesn’t detect drift, it doesn’t mean there isn’t drift.

I’ve created a small CLI tool, ft_drift, that detects drift between two multi-turn chat formatted jsonl files. Currently, ft_drift only detects drift in prompt templates, schemas and other token-based drift (as opposed to semantic drift). However, this is a good starting point to understand the general concept of adversarial validation. Here is a demo of this tool at work:\n\nThe demo is from a real-world example where an unintentional change in a prompt template caused unexpected behavior in a model. The demo shows the tool detecting a difference between two datasets, file_a.jsonl and file_b.jsonl. Afterward, a table of important tokens that account for the drift are shown, such as END-UI-FORMAT, UI-FORMAT, etc. We were able to apply the tool and quickly find the root cause of the issue. The modeling code is embarrassingly simple and located at ft_drift/model.py. The point is you don’t need sophisticated techniques to get started. You can then take this approach further by adding embeddings to your features to also detect semantic drift. Similarly, you could add additional features by hand like the number of conversation turns, length of messages, etc."

Identifying and involving this Principal Domain Expert early in the process is critical.\nWhy is finding the right domain expert so important?\n\nThey Set the Standard: This person not only defines what is acceptable technically, but also helps you understand if you’re building something users actually want.\nCapture Unspoken Expectations: By involving them, you uncover their preferences and expectations, which they might not be able to fully articulate upfront. Through the evaluation process, you help them clarify what a “passable” AI interaction looks like.\nConsistency in Judgment: People in your organization may have different opinions about the AI’s performance. Focusing on the principal expert ensures that evaluations are consistent and aligned with the most critical standards.\nSense of Ownership: Involving the expert gives them a stake in the AI’s development. They feel invested because they’ve had a hand in shaping it. In the end, they are more likely to approve of the AI.\n\nExamples of Principal Domain Experts:\n\nA psychologist for a mental health AI assistant.\nA lawyer for an AI that analyzes legal documents.\nA customer service director for a support chatbot.\nA lead teacher or curriculum developer for an educational AI tool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExceptions\n\n\n\nIn a smaller company, this might be the CEO or founder. If you are an independent developer, you should be the domain expert (but be honest with yourself about your expertise).\nIf you must rely on leadership, you should regularly validate their assumptions against real user feedback.\n\n\nMany developers attempt to act as the domain expert themselves, or find a convenient proxy (ex: their superior). This is a recipe for disaster. People will have varying opinions about what is acceptable, and you can’t make everyone happy. What’s important is that your principal domain expert is satisfied.\nRemember: This doesn’t have to take a lot of the domain expert’s time. Later in this post, I’ll discuss how you can make the process efficient.

For example: User asks “Where’s my order?” but has three active orders (#123, #124, #125). AI must help identify which specific order they’re asking about.\n\n\nNo Matches Found\nUser’s request yields no results, requiring alternatives or corrections. For example: User searches for order #ABC-123 which doesn’t exist. AI should explain valid order formats and suggest checking their confirmation email.\n\n\nAmbiguous Request\nUser input lacks necessary specificity. For example: User says “I need to change my delivery” without specifying which order or what aspect of delivery (date, address, etc.) they want to change.\n\n\nInvalid Data Provided\nUser provides incorrect data type or format. For example: User tries to track a return using a regular order number instead of a return authorization (RMA) number.\n\n\nSystem Errors\nTechnical issues prevent normal operation. For example: While looking up an order, the inventory database is temporarily unavailable. AI needs to explain the situation and provide alternatives.\n\n\nIncomplete Information\nUser omits required details. For example: User wants to initiate a return but hasn’t provided the order number or reason. AI needs to collect this information step by step.\n\n\nUnsupported Feature\nUser requests functionality that doesn’t exist. For example: User asks to change payment method after order has shipped.

For example, it may not make sense to even have personas if users aren’t directly engaging with your AI. The idea is you should outline dimensions that make sense for your use case and generate data that covers them. You’ll likely refine these after the first round of evaluations.\n\n\nGenerating Data\nTo build your dataset, you can:\n\nUse Existing Data: Sample real user interactions or behaviors from your AI system.\nGenerate Synthetic Data: Use LLMs to create realistic user inputs covering various features, scenarios, and personas.\n\nOften, you’ll do a combination of both to ensure comprehensive coverage. Synthetic data is not as good as real data, but it’s a good starting point. Also, we are only using LLMs to generate the user inputs, not the LLM responses or internal system behavior.\nRegardless of whether you use existing data or synthetic data, you want good coverage across the dimensions you’ve defined.\nIncorporating System Information\nWhen making test data, use your APIs and databases where appropriate. This will create realistic data and trigger the right scenarios. Sometimes you’ll need to write simple programs to get this information. That’s what the “Assumptions” column is referring to in the examples below.\n\n\nExample LLM Prompts for Generating User Inputs\nHere are some example prompts that illustrate how to use an LLM to generate synthetic user inputs for different combinations of features, scenarios, and personas:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\nFeature\nScenario\nPersona\nLLM Prompt to Generate User Input\nAssumptions (not directly in the prompt)\n\n\n\n\n1\nOrder Tracking\nInvalid Data Provided\nFrustrated Customer\n“Generate a user input from someone who is clearly irritated and impatient, using short, terse language to demand information about their order status for order number #1234567890. Include hints of previous negative experiences.”\nOrder number #1234567890 does not exist in the system.\n\n\n2\nContact Search\nMultiple Matches Found\nNew User\n“Create a user input from someone who seems unfamiliar with the system, using hesitant language and asking for help to find contact information for a person named ‘Alex’. The user should appear unsure about what information is needed.”\nMultiple contacts named ‘Alex’ exist in the system.\n\n\n3\nMeeting Scheduler\nAmbiguous Request\nBusy Professional\n“Simulate a user input from someone who is clearly in a hurry, using abbreviated language and minimal details to request scheduling a meeting. The message should feel rushed and lack specific information.”\nN/A\n\n\n4\nContent Recommendation\nNo Matches Found\nExpert User\n“Produce a user input from someone who demonstrates in-depth knowledge of their industry, using specific terminology to request articles on sustainable supply chain management. Use the information in this article involving sustainable supply chain management to formulate a plausible query: {{article}}”\nNo articles on ‘Emerging trends in sustainable supply chain management’ exist in the system.\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerating Synthetic Data\nWhen generating synthetic data, you only need to create the user inputs. You then feed these inputs into your AI system to generate the AI’s responses. It’s important that you log everything so you can evaluate your AI. To recap, here’s the process:\n\nGenerate User Inputs: Use the LLM prompts to create realistic user inputs.\nFeed Inputs into Your AI System: Input the user interactions into your AI as it currently exists.\nCapture AI Responses: Record the AI’s responses to form complete interactions.\nOrganize the Interactions: Create a table to store the user inputs, AI responses, and relevant metadata.\n\n\nHow much data should you generate?\nThere is no right answer here. At a minimum, you want to generate enough data so that you have examples for each combination of dimensions (in this toy example: features, scenarios, and personas). However, you also want to keep generating more data until you feel like you have stopped seeing new failure modes. The amount of data I generate varies significantly depending on the use case.\n\n\nDoes synthetic data actually work?\nYou might be skeptical of using synthetic data. After all, it’s not real data, so how can it be a good proxy? In my experience, it works surprisingly well. Some of my favorite AI products, like Hex use synthetic data to power their evals:\n\n“LLMs are surprisingly good at generating excellent - and diverse - examples of user prompts. This can be relevant for powering application features, and sneakily, for building Evals. If this sounds a bit like the Large Language Snake is eating its tail, I was just as surprised as you! All I can say is: it works, ship it.” Bryan Bischof, Head of AI Engineering at Hex\n\n\n\n\nNext Steps\nWith your dataset ready, now comes the most important part: getting your principal domain expert to evaluate the interactions."

    "section": "Step 3: Direct The Domain Expert to Make Pass/Fail Judgments with Critiques",
    "text": "Step 3: Direct The Domain Expert to Make Pass/Fail Judgments with Critiques\nThe domain expert’s job is to focus on one thing: “Did the AI achieve the desired outcome?” No complex scoring scales or multiple metrics. Just a clear pass or fail decision. In addition to the pass/fail decision, the domain expert should write a critique that explains their reasoning.\n\nWhy are simple pass/fail metrics important?\n\nClarity and Focus: A binary decision forces everyone to consider what truly matters. It simplifies the evaluation to a single, crucial question.\nActionable Insights: Pass/fail judgments are easy to interpret and act upon. They help you quickly identify whether the AI meets the user’s needs.\nForces Articulation of Expectations: When domain experts must decide if an interaction passes or fails, they are compelled to articulate their expectations clearly. This process uncovers nuances and unspoken assumptions about how the AI should behave.\nEfficient Use of Resources: Keeps the evaluation process manageable, especially when starting out. You avoid getting bogged down in detailed metrics that might not be meaningful yet.\n\n\n\nThe Role of Critiques\nAlongside a binary pass/fail judgment, it’s important to write a detailed critique of the LLM-generated output. These critiques:\n\nCaptures Nuances: The critique allows you to note if something was mostly correct but had areas for improvement.\nGuide Improvement: Detailed feedback provides specific insights into how the AI can be enhanced.\nBalance Simplicity with Depth: While the pass/fail offers a clear verdict, the critique offers the depth needed to understand the reasoning behind the judgment.\n\nWhy Write Critiques?:\nIn practice, domain experts may not have fully internalized all the judgment criteria. By forcing them to make a pass/fail decision and explain their reasoning, they clarify their expectations and provide valuable guidance for refining the AI.\n“But my problem is complex!” Trust me—starting simple forces you to focus on what truly matters. You can introduce more complexity later if needed.\n\n\nExamples of Good Critiques\nTo illustrate how simple pass/fail judgments combined with detailed critiques work in practice, here’s a table showcasing examples of user interactions with an AI assistant. The table includes both passes and fails, with critiques explaining why the AI received that judgment. In cases where the AI passed despite critical issues, the critique highlights these aspects and justifies why it still passed overall. For failed interactions, the critique explains the critical elements that led to the failure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser Interaction with AI\nJudgment\nCritique\n\n\n\n\nUser: “I need to cancel my flight booking for next week.”AI: “Your flight booking for next week has been canceled. A confirmation email has been sent to you.”\nPass\nThe AI successfully executed the user’s request by canceling the flight and sending a confirmation, achieving the primary goal. However, it should have asked for confirmation before proceeding to prevent accidental cancellations. Despite this critical oversight, the AI fulfilled the user’s request, so it passes, but adding a confirmation step would improve user safety.\n\n\nUser: “What’s the capital of France?”AI: “The capital of France is Paris.”\nPass\nThe AI correctly answered the user’s question, providing accurate information promptly. Although the response is sufficient, the AI could enhance the interaction by offering additional interesting facts or asking if the user has more questions. Despite this opportunity for added engagement, the AI met the user’s primary need, so it passes.\n\n\nUser: “I can’t log into my account; it says my password is incorrect.”AI: “Please reset your password by clicking ‘Forgot Password’.”\nFail\nThe AI provided a generic solution without acknowledging the user’s frustration or checking for other issues like account lockout. It failed to offer empathetic support or additional assistance. Due to the lack of personalized help and poor user experience, it fails.\n\n\nUser: “Book a table for two at an Italian restaurant tonight at 7 PM.”AI: “Table for two at Luigi’s Italian Restaurant booked for tonight at 7 PM. Confirmation number is 12345.”\nPass\nThe AI efficiently completed the booking as requested, providing all necessary details and a confirmation number. However, it could have asked if the user had seating preferences or dietary restrictions. The AI accomplished the primary task successfully, so it passes, with minor opportunities for enhanced service.\n\n\nUser: “I need help with my billing statement.”AI: “Please provide your account number and full name.”\nFail\nThe AI requested sensitive information without verifying the user’s identity through secure means, potentially compromising security. It should guide the user through a secure authentication process first. Due to this critical oversight in user data protection, it fails.\n\n\n\nThese examples demonstrate how the AI can receive both “Pass” and “Fail” judgments. In the critiques:\n\nFor passes, we explain why the AI succeeded in meeting the user’s primary need, even if there were critical aspects that could be improved. We highlight these areas for enhancement while justifying the overall passing judgment.\nFor fails, we identify the critical elements that led to the failure, explaining why the AI did not meet the user’s main objective or compromised important factors like user experience or security.\n\nMost importantly, the critique should be detailed enough so that you can use it in a few-shot prompt for a LLM judge. In other words, it should be detailed enough that a new employee could understand it. Being too terse is a common mistake.\nNote that the example user interactions with the AI are simplified for brevity - but you might need to give the domain expert more context to make a judgement. More on that later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAt this point, you don’t need to perform a root cause analysis into the technical reasons behind why the AI failed. Many times, it’s useful to get a sense of overall behavior before diving into the weeds.\n\n\n\n\nDon’t stray from binary pass/fail judgments when starting out\nA common mistake is straying from binary pass/fail judgments. Let’s revisit the dashboard from earlier:\n\nIf your evaluations consist of a bunch of metrics that LLMs score on a 1-5 scale (or any other scale), you’re doing it wrong. Let’s unpack why.\n\nIt’s not actionable: People don’t know what to do with a 3 or 4. It’s not immediately obvious how this number is better than a 2. You need to be able to say “this interaction passed because…” and “this interaction failed because…”.\nMore often than not, these metrics do not matter. Every time I’ve analyzed data on domain expert judgments, they tend not to correlate with these kind of metrics. By having a domain expert make a binary judgment, you can figure out what truly matters.\n\nThis is why I hate off the shelf metrics that come with many evaluation frameworks. They tend to lead people astray.\nCommon Objections to Pass/Fail Judgments:\n\n“The business said that these 8 dimensions are important, so we need to evaluate all of them.”\n“We need to be able to say why an interaction passed or failed.”\n\nI can guarantee you that if someone says you need to measure 8 things on a 1-5 scale, they don’t know what they are looking for. They are just guessing. You have to let the domain expert drive and make a pass/fail judgment with critiques so you can figure out what truly matters. Stand your ground here.\n\n\nMake it easy for the domain expert to review data\nFinally, you need to remove all friction from reviewing data. I’ve written about this here. Sometimes, you can just use a spreadsheet. It’s a judgement call in terms of what is easiest for the domain expert. I found that I often have to provide additional context to help the domain expert understand the user interaction, such as:\n\nMetadata about the user, such as their location, subscription tier, etc.\nAdditional context about the system, such as the current time, inventory levels, etc.\nResources so you can check if the AI’s response is correct (ex: ability to search a database, etc.)\n\nAll of this data needs to be presented on a single screen so the domain expert can review it without jumping through hoops. That’s why I recommend building a simple web app to review data.\n\n\nHow many examples do you need?\nThe number of examples you need depends on the complexity of the task. My heuristic is that I start with around 30 examples and keep going until I do not see any new failure modes. From there, I keep going until I’m not learning anything new.\nNext, we’ll look at how to use this data to build an LLM judge."

Remember, the whole point of the LLM as a judge is to help you find these errors, so it’s totally fine if you find them earlier!\nIf you have already developed Level 1 evals as outlined in my previous post, you should not have any pervasive errors. However, these errors can sometimes slip through the cracks. If you find pervasive errors, fix them and go back to step 3. Keep iterating until you feel like you have stabilized your system."

    "section": "Step 5: Build Your LLM as A Judge, Iteratively",
    "text": "Step 5: Build Your LLM as A Judge, Iteratively\n\nThe Hidden Power of Critiques\nYou cannot write a good judge prompt until you’ve seen the data. The paper from Shankar et al., “Who Validates the Validators? Aligning LLM-Assisted Evaluation of LLM Outputs with Human Preferences” summarizes this well:\n\nto grade outputs,people need to externalize and define their evaluation criteria; however, the process of grading outputs helps them to define that very criteria. We dub this phenomenon criteria drift, and it implies thatit is impossible to completely determine evaluation criteria prior to human judging of LLM outputs.\n\n\n\nStart with Expert Examples\nLet me share a real-world example of building an LLM judge you can apply to your own use case. When I was helping Honeycomb build their Query Assistant feature, we needed a way to evaluate if the AI was generating good queries. Here’s what our LLM judge prompt looked like, including few-shot examples of critiques from our domain expert, Phillip:\nYou are a Honeycomb query evaluator with advanced capabilities to judge if a query is good or not.\nYou understand the nuances of the Honeycomb query language, including what is likely to be\nmost useful from an analytics perspective. \n\nHere is information about the Honeycomb query language:\n{{query_language_info}}\n\nHere are some guidelines for evaluating queries:\n{{guidelines}}\n\nExample evaluations:\n\n&lt;examples&gt;\n\n&lt;example-1&gt;\n&lt;nlq&gt;show me traces where ip is 10.0.2.90&lt;/nlq&gt;\n&lt;query&gt;\n{\n  \"breakdowns\": [\"trace.trace_id\"],\n  \"calculations\": [{\"op\": \"COUNT\"}],\n  \"filters\": [{\"column\": \"net.host.ip\", \"op\": \"=\", \"value\": \"10.0.2.90\"}]\n}\n&lt;/query&gt;\n&lt;critique&gt;\n{\n  \"critique\": \"The query correctly filters for traces with an IP address of 10.0.2.90 \n   and counts the occurrences of those traces, grouped by trace.trace_id. The response \n   is good as it meets the requirement of showing traces from a specific IP address \n   without additional complexities.\",\n  \"outcome\": \"good\"\n}\n&lt;/critique&gt;\n&lt;/example-1&gt;\n\n&lt;example-2&gt;\n&lt;nlq&gt;show me slowest trace&lt;/nlq&gt;\n&lt;query&gt;\n{\n  \"calculations\": [{\"column\": \"duration_ms\", \"op\": \"MAX\"}],\n  \"orders\": [{\"column\": \"duration_ms\", \"op\": \"MAX\", \"order\": \"descending\"}],\n  \"limit\": 1\n}\n&lt;/query&gt;\n&lt;critique&gt;\n{\n  \"critique\": \"While the query attempts to find the slowest trace using MAX(duration_ms) \n   and ordering correctly, it fails to group by trace.trace_id. Without this grouping, \n   the query only shows the MAX(duration_ms) measurement over time, not the actual \n   slowest trace.\",\n  \"outcome\": \"bad\"\n}\n&lt;/critique&gt;\n&lt;/example-2&gt;\n\n&lt;example-3&gt;\n&lt;nlq&gt;count window-hash where window-hash exists per hour&lt;/nlq&gt;\n&lt;query&gt;\n{\n  \"breakdowns\": [\"window-hash\"],\n  \"calculations\": [{\"op\": \"COUNT\"}],\n  \"filters\": [{\"column\": \"window-hash\", \"op\": \"exists\"}],\n  \"time_range\": 3600\n}\n&lt;/query&gt;\n&lt;critique&gt;\n{\n  \"critique\": \"While the query correctly counts window-hash occurrences, the time_range \n   of 3600 seconds (1 hour) is insufficient for per-hour analysis. When we say 'per hour', \n   we need a time_range of at least 36000 seconds to show meaningful hourly patterns.\",\n  \"outcome\": \"bad\"\n}\n&lt;/critique&gt;\n&lt;/example-3&gt;\n\n&lt;/examples&gt;\n\nFor the following query, first write a detailed critique explaining your reasoning,\nthen provide a pass/fail judgment in the same format as above.\n\n&lt;nlq&gt;{{user_input}}&lt;/nlq&gt;\n&lt;query&gt;\n{{generated_query}}\n&lt;/query&gt;\n&lt;critique&gt;\nNotice how each example includes:\n\nThe natural language query (NLQ) in &lt;nlq&gt; tags\nThe generated query in &lt;query&gt; tags\nThe critique and outcome in &lt;critique&gt; tags\n\nIn the prompt above, the example critiques are fixed. An advanced approach is to include examples dynamically based upon the item you are judging. You can learn more in this post about Continual In-Context Learning.\n\n\nKeep Iterating on the Prompt Until Convergence With Domain Expert\nIn this case, I used a low-tech approach to iterate on the prompt. I sent Phillip a spreadsheet with the following information:\n\nThe NLQ\nThe generated query\nThe critique\nThe outcome (pass or fail)\n\nPhillip would then fill out his own version of the spreadsheet with his critiques. I used this to iteratively improve the prompt. The spreadsheet looked like this:\n\nI also tracked agreement rates over time to ensure we were converging on a good prompt.\n\nIt took us only three iterations to achieve &gt; 90% agreement between the LLM and Phillip. Your mileage may vary depending on the complexity of the task. For example, Swyx has conducted a similar process hundreds of times for AI News, an extremely popular news aggregator with high quality recommendations. The quality of the AI owing to this process is why this product has received critical acclaim.\n\n\nHow to Optimize the LLM Judge Prompt?\nI usually adjust the prompts by hand. I haven’t had much luck with prompt optimizers like DSPy. However, my friend Eugene Yan has just released a promising tool named ALIGN Eval. I like it because it’s simple and effective. Also, don’t forget the approach of continual in-context learning mentioned earlier - it can be effective when implemented correctly.\nIn rare cases, I might fine-tune a judge, but I prefer not to. I talk about this more in the FAQ section.\n\n\nThe Human Side of the Process\nSomething unexpected happened during this process. Phillip Carter, our domain expert at Honeycomb, found that reviewing the LLM’s critiques helped him articulate his own evaluation criteria more clearly. He said,\n\n“Seeing how the LLM breaks down its reasoning made me realize I wasn’t being consistent about how I judged certain edge cases.”\n\nThis is a pattern I’ve seen repeatedly—the process of building an LLM judge often helps standardize evaluation criteria.\nFurthermore, because this process forces the domain expert to look at data carefully, I always uncover new insights about the product, AI capabilities, and user needs. The resulting benefits are often more valuable than creating a LLM judge!\n\n\nHow Often Should You Evaluate?\nI conduct this human review at regular intervals and whenever something material changes. For example, if I update a model, I’ll run the process again. I don’t get too scientific here; instead, I rely on my best judgment. Also note that after the first two iterations, I tend to focus more on errors rather than sampling randomly. For example, if I find an error, I’ll search for more examples that I think might trigger the same error. However, I always do a bit of random sampling as well.\n\n\nWhat if this doesn’t work?\nI’ve seen this process fail when:\n\nThe AI is overscoped: Example - a chatbot in a SaaS product that promises to do anything you want.\nThe process is not followed correctly: Not using the principal domain expert, not writing proper critiques, etc.\nThe expectations of alignment are unrealistic or not feasible.\n\nIn each of these cases, I try to address the root cause instead of trying to force alignment. Sometimes, you may not be able to achieve the alignment you want and may have to lean heavier on human annotations. However, after following the process described here, you will have metrics that help you understand how much you can trust the LLM judge.\n\n\nMistakes I’ve noticed in LLM judge prompts\nMost of the mistakes I’ve seen in LLM judge prompts have to do with not providing good examples:\n\nNot providing any critiques.\nWriting extremely terse critiques.\nNot providing external context. Your examples should contain the same information you use to evaluate, including external information like user metadata, system information etc.\nNot providing diverse examples. You need a wide variety of examples to ensure that your judge works for a wide variety of inputs.\n\nSometimes, you may encounter difficulties with fitting everything you need into the prompt, and may have to get creative about how you structure the examples. However, this is becoming less of an issue thanks to expanding context windows and prompt caching."

    "section": "Step 6: Perform Error Analysis",
    "text": "Step 6: Perform Error Analysis\nAfter you have created a LLM as a judge, you will have a dataset of user interactions with the AI, and the LLM’s judgments. If your metrics show an acceptable agreement between the domain expert and the LLM judge, you can apply this judge against real or synthetic interactions. After this, you can you calculate error rates for different dimensions of your data. You should calculate the error on unseen data only to make sure your aren’t getting biased results.\nFor example, if you have segmented your data by persona, scenario, feature, etc, your data analysis may look like this\nError Rates by Key Dimensions\n\n\n\nFeature\nScenario\nPersona\nTotal Examples\nFailure Rate\n\n\n\n\nOrder Tracking\nMultiple Matches\nNew User\n42\n24.3%\n\n\nOrder Tracking\nMultiple Matches\nExpert User\n38\n18.4%\n\n\nOrder Tracking\nNo Matches\nExpert User\n30\n23.3%\n\n\nOrder Tracking\nNo Matches\nNew User\n20\n75.0%\n\n\nContact Search\nMultiple Matches\nNew User\n35\n22.9%\n\n\nContact Search\nMultiple Matches\nExpert User\n32\n19.7%\n\n\nContact Search\nNo Matches\nNew User\n25\n68.0%\n\n\nContact Search\nNo Matches\nExpert User\n28\n21.4%\n\n\n\n\nClassify Traces\nOnce you know where the errors are now you can perform an error analysis to get to the root cause of the errors. My favorite way is to look at examples of each type of error and classify them by hand. I recommend using a spreadsheet for this. For example, a trace for Order tracking where there are no matches for new users might look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample Trace\n\n\n\nIn this example trace, the user provides an invalid order number. The AI correctly identifies that the order number is invalid but provides an unhelpful response. If you are not familiar with logging LLM traces, refer to my previous post on evals.\nNote that this trace is formatted for readability.\n{\n \"user_input\": \"Where's my order #ABC123?\",\n \"function_calls\": [\n   {\n     \"name\": \"search_order_database\",\n     \"args\": {\"order_id\": \"ABC123\"},\n     \"result\": {\n       \"status\": \"not_found\",\n       \"valid_patterns\": [\"XXX-XXX-XXX\"]\n     }\n   },\n   {\n     \"name\": \"retrieve_context\",\n     \"result\": {\n       \"relevant_docs\": [\n         \"Order numbers follow format XXX-XXX-XXX\",\n         \"New users should check confirmation email\"\n       ]\n     }\n   }\n ],\n \"llm_intermediate_steps\": [\n   {\n     \"thought\": \"User is new and order format is invalid\",\n     \"action\": \"Generate help message with format info\"\n   }\n ],\n \"final_response\": \"I cannot find that order #. Please check the number and try again.\"\n}\n\n\nIn this case, you might classify the error as: Missing User Education. The system retrieved new user context and format information but failed to include it in the response, which suggests we could improve our prompt. After you have classified a number of errors, you can calculate the distribution of errors by root cause. That might look like this:\nRoot Cause Distribution (20 Failed Interactions)\n\n\n\nRoot Cause\nCount\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nMissing User Education\n8\n40%\n\n\nAuthentication/Access Issues\n6\n30%\n\n\nPoor Context Handling\n4\n20%\n\n\nInadequate Error Messages\n2\n10%\n\n\n\nNow you know where to focus your efforts. This doesn’t have to take an extraordinary amount of time. You can get quite far in just 15 minutes. Also, you can use a LLM to help you with this classification, but that is beyond the scope of this post (you can use a LLM to help you do anything in this post, as long as you have a process to verify the results).\n\n\nAn Interactive Walkthrough of Error Analysis\nError analysis has been around in Machine Learning for quite some time. This video by Andrew Ng does a great job of walking through the process interactively:\n\n\n\nFix Your Errors, Again\nNow that you have a sense of the errors, you can go back and fix them again. Go back to step 3 and iterate until you are satisfied. Note that every time you fix an error, you should try to write a test case for it. Sometimes, this can be an assertion in your test suite, but other times you may need to create a more “specialized” LLM judge for these failures. We’ll talk about this next.\n\n\nDoing this well requires data literacy\nInvestigating your data is much harder in practice than I made it look in this post. It requires a nose for data that only comes from practice. It also helps to have some basic familiarity with statistics and data analysis tools. My favorite post on data literacy is this one by Jason Liu and Eugene Yan."

Let’s list out the steps:\n\nFind Principal Domain Expert\nCreate A Dataset\n\nGenerate diverse examples covering your use cases\nInclude real or synthetic user interactions\n\nDomain Expert Reviews Data\n\nExpert makes pass/fail judgments\nExpert writes detailed critiques explaining their reasoning\n\nFix Errors (if found)\n\nAddress any issues discovered during review\nReturn to expert review to verify fixes\nGo back to step 3 if errors are found\n\nBuild LLM Judge\n\nCreate prompt using expert examples\nTest against expert judgments\nRefine prompt until agreement is satisfactory\n\nPerform Error Analysis\n\nCalculate error rates across different dimensions\nIdentify patterns and root causes\nFix errors and go back to step 3 if needed\nCreate specialized judges as needed\n\n\nThis process never truly ends. It repeats periodically or when material changes occur.\n\nIt’s Not The Judge That Created Value, Afterall\nThe real value of this process is looking at your data and doing careful analysis. Even though an AI judge can be a helpful tool, going through this process is what drives results. I would go as far as saying that creating a LLM judge is a nice “hack” I use to trick people into carefully looking at their data!\nThat’s right. The real business value comes from looking at your data. But hey, potato, potahto.\n\n\nDo You Really Need This?\nPhew, this seems like a lot of work! Do you really need this? Well, it depends. There are cases where you can take a shortcut through this process. For example, let’s say:\n\nYou are an independent developer who is also a domain expert.\nYou are working with test data that already available. (Tweets, etc.)\nLooking at data is not costly (etc. you can manually look at enough data in a few hours)\n\nIn this scenario, you can jump directly to something that looks like step 3 and start looking at data right away. Also, since it’s not that costly to look at data, it’s probably fine to just do error analysis without a judge (at least initially). You can incorporate what you learn directly back into your primary model right away. This example is not exhaustive, but gives you an idea of how you can adapt this process to your needs.\nHowever, you can never completely eliminate looking at your data! This is precisely the step that most people skip. Don’t be that person."

    "section": "FAQ",
    "text": "FAQ\nI received a lot of questions about this topic. Here are answers to the most common ones:\n\nIf I have a good judge LLM, isn’t that also the LLM I’d also want to use?\nEffective judges often use larger models or more compute (via longer prompts, chain-of-thought, etc.) than the systems they evaluate.\nHowever, If the cost of the most powerful LLM is not prohibitive, and latency is not an issue, then you might want to consider where you invest your efforts differently. In this case, it might make sense to put more effort towards specialist LLM judges, code-based assertions, and A/B testing. However, you should still go through the process of looking at data and critiquing the LLM’s output before you adopt specialized judges.\n\n\nDo you recommend fine-tuning judges?\nI prefer not to fine-tune LLM judges. I’d rather spend the effort fine-tuning the actual LLM instead. However, fine-tuning guardrails or other specialized judges can be useful (especially if they are small classifiers).\nAs a related note, you can leverage a LLM judge to curate and transform data for fine-tuning your primary model. For example, you can use the judge to:\n\nEliminate bad examples for fine-tuning.\nGenerate higher quality outputs (by referencing the critique).\nSimulate high quality chain-of-thought with critiques.\n\nUsing a LLM judge for enhancing fine-tuning data is even more compelling when you are trying to distill a large LLM into a smaller one. The details of fine-tuning are beyond the scope of this post. If you are interested in learning more, see these resources.\n\n\nWhat’s wrong with off-the-shelf LLM judges?\nNothing is strictly wrong with them. It’s just that many people are led astray by them. If you are disciplined you can apply them to your data and see if they are telling you something valuable. However, I’ve found that these tend to cause more confusion than value.\n\n\nHow Do you evaluate the LLM judge?\nYou will collect metrics on the agreement between the domain expert and the LLM judge. This tells you how much you can trust the judge and in what scenarios. Your domain expert doesn’t have to inspect every single example, you just need a representative sample so you can have reliable statistics.\n\n\nWhat model do you use for the LLM judge?\nFor the kind of judge articulated in this blog post, I like to use the most powerful model I can afford in my cost/latency budget. This budget might be different than my primary model, depending on the number of examples I need to score. This can vary significantly according to the use case.\n\n\nWhat about guardrails?\nGuardrails are a separate but related topic. They are a way to prevent the LLM from saying/doing something harmful or inappropriate. This blog post focuses on helping you create a judge that’s aligned with business goals, especially when starting out.\n\n\nI’m using LLM as a judge, and getting tremendous value but I didn’t follow this approach.\nI believe you. This blog post is not the only way to use a LLM as a judge. In fact, I’ve seen people use a LLM as a judge in all sorts of creative ways, which include ranking, classification, model selection and so-on. I’m focused on an approach that works well when you are getting started, and avoids the pitfalls of confusing metric sprawl. However, the general process of looking at the data is still central no matter what kind of judge you are building.\n\n\nHow do you choose between traditional ML techniques, LLM-as-a-judge and human annotations?\nThe answer to this (and many other questions) is: do the simplest thing that works. And simple doesn’t always mean traditional ML techniques. Depending on your situation, it might be easier to use a LLM API as a classifier than to train a model and deploy it.\n\n\nCan you make judges from small models?\nYes, potentially. I’ve only used the larger models for judges. You have to base the answer to this question on the data (i.e. the agreement with the domain expert).\n\n\nHow do you ensure consistency when updating your LLM model?\nYou have to go through the process again and measure the results.\n\n\nHow do you phase out human in the loop to scale this?\nYou don’t need a domain expert to grade every single example. You just need a representative sample. I don’t think you can eliminate humans completely, because the LLM still needs to be aligned to something, and that something is usually a human. As your evaluation system gets better, it naturally reduces the amount of human effort required."

    "text": "General Tips\nWhile debugging, it’s helpful to simplify your test scenario as much as possible. Here are some tips for doing so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll of these tips are incorporated into the example configuration for debugging with VSCode below.\n\n\n\nMake sure you are using the latest version of axolotl: This project changes often and bugs get fixed fast. Check your git branch and make sure you have pulled the latest changes from main.\nEliminate Concurrency: Restrict the number of processes to 1 for both training and data preprocessing:\n\nSet CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES to a single GPU, ex: export CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0.\nSet dataset_processes: 1 in your axolotl config or run the training command with --dataset_processes=1.\n\nUse a small dataset: Construct or use a small dataset from HF Hub. When using a small dataset, you will often have to make sure sample_packing: False and eval_sample_packing: False to avoid errors. If you are in a pinch and don’t have time to construct a small dataset but want to use from the HF Hub, you can shard the data (this will still tokenize the entire dataset but will only use a fraction of the data for training. For example, to shard the dataset into 20 pieces, add the following to your axolotl config):\ndataset:\n    ...\n    shards: 20\nUse a small model: A good example of a small model is TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.\nMinimize iteration time: Make sure the training loop finishes as fast as possible, with these settings.\n\nmicro_batch_size: 1\nmax_steps: 1\nval_set_size: 0\n\nClear Caches: Axolotl caches certain steps and so does the underlying HuggingFace trainer. You may want to clear some of these caches when debugging.\n\nData preprocessing: When debugging data preprocessing, which includes prompt template formation, you may want to delete the directory set in dataset_prepared_path: in your axolotl config. If you didn’t set this value, the default is last_run_prepared.\nHF Hub: If you are debugging data preprocessing, you should clear the relevant HF cache HuggingFace cache, by deleting the appropriate ~/.cache/huggingface/datasets/... folder(s).\nThe recommended approach is to redirect all outputs and caches to a temporary folder and delete selected subfolders before each run. This is demonstrated in the example configuration below."

    "title": "How To Debug Axolotl",
    "section": "Debugging with VSCode",
    "text": "Debugging with VSCode\n\nBackground\nThe below example shows how to configure VSCode to debug data preprocessing of the sharegpt format. This is the format used when you have the following in your axolotl config:\ndatasets:\n  - path: &lt;path to your sharegpt formatted dataset&gt; # example on HF Hub: philschmid/guanaco-sharegpt-style\n    type: sharegpt\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIf you are already familiar with advanced VSCode debugging, you can skip the below explanation and look at the files .vscode/launch.json and .vscode/tasks.json for an example configuration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you prefer to watch a video, rather than read, you can skip to the video tutorial below (but doing both is recommended).\n\n\n\n\nSetup\nMake sure you have an editable install of Axolotl, which ensures that changes you make to the code are reflected at runtime. Run the following commands from the root of this project:\npip3 install packaging\npip3 install -e '.[flash-attn,deepspeed]'\n\nRemote Hosts\nIf you developing on a remote host, you can easily use VSCode to debug remotely. To do so, you will need to follow this remote - SSH guide. You can also see the video below on Docker and Remote SSH debugging.\n\n\n\nConfiguration\nThe easiest way to get started is to modify the .vscode/launch.json file in the axolotl GitHub repo. This is just an example configuration, so you may need to modify or copy it to suit your needs.\nFor example, to mimic the command cd devtools && CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 accelerate launch -m axolotl.cli.train dev_sharegpt.yml, you would use the below configuration1. Note that we add additional flags that override the axolotl config and incorporate the tips above (see the comments). We also set the working directory to devtools and set the env variable HF_HOME to a temporary folder that is later partially deleted. This is because we want to delete the HF dataset cache before each run in order to ensure that the data preprocessing code is run from scratch.\n// https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl/blob/main/.vscode/launch.json\n{\n    \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n    \"configurations\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"Debug axolotl prompt - sharegpt\",\n            \"type\": \"python\",\n            \"module\": \"accelerate.commands.launch\",\n            \"request\": \"launch\",\n            \"args\": [\n                \"-m\", \"axolotl.cli.train\", \"dev_sharegpt.yml\",\n                // The flags below simplify debugging by overriding the axolotl config \n                // with the debugging tips above.

If you want to step into dependencies, set this to false.\nThe preLaunchTask: cleanup-for-dataprep is defined in .vscode/tasks.json and is used to delete the following folders before debugging, which is essential to ensure that the data pre-processing code is run from scratch:\n\n./devtools/temp_debug/axolotl_outputs\n./devtools/temp_debug/.hf-cache/datasets\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou may not want to delete these folders. For example, if you are debugging model training instead of data pre-processing, you may NOT want to delete the cache or output folders. You may also need to add additional tasks to the tasks.json file depending on your use case.\n\n\nBelow is the ./vscode/tasks.json file that defines the cleanup-for-dataprep task. This task is run before each debugging session when you use the above configuration. Note how there are two tasks that delete the two folders mentioned above. The third task cleanup-for-dataprep is a composite task that combines the two tasks. A composite task is necessary because VSCode does not allow you to specify multiple tasks in the preLaunchTask argument of the launch.json file.\n// https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl/blob/main/.vscode/tasks.json\n// this file is used by launch.json\n{\n    \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n    \"tasks\": [\n      // this task changes into the devtools directory and deletes the temp_debug/axolotl_outputs folder\n      {\n        \"label\": \"delete-outputs\",\n        \"type\": \"shell\",\n        \"command\": \"rm -rf temp_debug/axolotl_outputs\",\n        \"options\":{ \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}/devtools\"},\n        \"problemMatcher\": []\n      },\n      // this task changes into the devtools directory and deletes the `temp_debug/.hf-cache/datasets` folder\n      {\n        \"label\": \"delete-temp-hf-dataset-cache\",\n        \"type\": \"shell\",\n        \"command\": \"rm -rf temp_debug/.hf-cache/datasets\",\n        \"options\":{ \"cwd\": \"${workspaceFolder}/devtools\"},\n        \"problemMatcher\": []\n      },\n        // this task combines the two tasks above\n      {\n       \"label\": \"cleanup-for-dataprep\",\n       \"dependsOn\": [\"delete-outputs\", \"delete-temp-hf-dataset-cache\"],\n      }\n    ]\n}\n\n\nCustomizing your debugger\nYour debugging use case may differ from the example above. The easiest thing to do is to put your own axolotl config in the devtools folder and modify the launch.json file to use your config. You may also want to modify the preLaunchTask to delete different folders or not delete anything at all.\n\n\nVideo Tutorial\nThe following video tutorial walks through the above configuration and demonstrates how to debug with VSCode:"

First, I will create a new environment named cuda11-7 with the following command:\nmamba create -n cuda11-7 python=3.8\nmamba activate cuda11-7\nBefore I downgrade, we can check our CUDA version with the following command:\n&gt; nvcc --version\n\nnvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver\nCopyright (c) 2005-2022 NVIDIA Corporation\nBuilt on Wed_Sep_21_10:33:58_PDT_2022\nCuda compilation tools, release 11.8, V11.8.89\nBuild cuda_11.8.r11.8/compiler.31833905_0\nAs you can see, I have CUDA version 11.8 but I want to downgrade to 11.7. We can downgrade CUDA by using cuda-toolkit:\nmamba install -c \"nvidia/label/cuda-11.7.1\" cuda-toolkit\nThis will take several minutes to complete. Next, recheck your CUDA version:\n&gt; nvcc --version\n\nnvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver\nCopyright (c) 2005-2022 NVIDIA Corporation\nBuilt on Wed_Jun__8_16:49:14_PDT_2022\nCuda compilation tools, release 11.7, V11.7.99\nBuild cuda_11.7.r11.7/compiler.31442593_0\nNext, you need to install the correct version of PyTorch for your CUDA version. It is crucial to install the right version of PyTorch that matches your CUDA version exactly. For example, if you want to install PyTorch with CUDA 11.7, you can use the following command:\nmamba install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia\nYou can find PyTorch installation instructions on this page.\nViola! You have downgraded your CUDA version successfully. Note that this version of CUDA is isolated to this specific environment.\nTo make sure that everything is working correctly, make sure you can import torch and check the CUDA version from within Python:\n&gt; python -c \"import torch; print(torch.version.cuda)\"\n11.7",

We want clear numbers to track improvement and automated tests to catch regressions. But this top-down approach often leads us to measure what’s easy to measure, not what actually matters to users.\nInstead of immediately jumping to metrics or tests, start by creating a simple spreadsheet to analyze real conversations. Here’s an example of how you might structure your error analysis:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConversation ID\nPrimary Issue\nCategory\nNotes\n\n\n\n\n1\nFailed to recall previous discussion about respite care\nMemory\nAssistant suggested respite care again without acknowledging it was discussed last week\n\n\n2\nGeneric advice not tailored to situation\nPersonalization\nDidn’t incorporate known context about user’s work schedule\n\n\n3\nMissed emotional cues\nEmpathy\nFocused on tactical solutions without addressing expressed anxiety\n\n\n\nThe goal isn’t to be comprehensive - it’s to start seeing patterns.

Focus on High-Traffic Topics\nInstead of trying to excel at everything, focus evaluation efforts on the 5-6 topics that drive most conversations. This doesn’t mean abandoning other topics, but rather acknowledging that some areas will be more polished than others.\n\n\n2. Segment Evaluation by Topic Type\nSome topics showed better alignment between human and LLM judgments than others. For example, verification questions performed well because they had clear information in their knowledge base. Shipping questions were more problematic due to complex data formatting.\n\n\n3. Consider Synthetic Data for Seasonal Patterns\nFor seasonal variations, Maggie realized they could generate synthetic data: “They’re going to ask different questions in the fall about seeding, timing, it being too late, or what about frost? But they’re going to ask the same… they’re still going to ask about seeding timing in the spring. It might just be, is it too early or is it too hot?”",

    "text": "Background\n\nOne pattern I noticed is that great AI researchers are willing to manually inspect lots of data. And more than that, they build infrastructure that allows them to manually inspect data quickly. Though not glamorous, manually examining data gives valuable intuitions about the problem. The canonical example here is Andrej Karpathy doing the ImageNet 2000-way classification task himself.\n– Jason Wei, AI Researcher at OpenAI\n\nI couldn’t agree with Jason more. I don’t think people look at their data enough. Building your own tools so you can quickly sort through and curate your data is one of the highest-impact activities you can do when working with LLMs. Looking at and curating your own data is critical for both evaluation and fine-tuning.",

    "text": "Things I tried\nAt the outset, I tried to avoid building something myself. I tried the following vendors who provide tools for data curation/review:\n\nVendors\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nThese tools are at varying levels of maturity. I interacted with the developers on all these products, and they were super responsive, kind and aware of these limitations. I expect that these tools will improve significantly over time.\n\n\n\nSpacy Prodigy: This was my favorite “pre-packaged” tool/framework. They have the cleanest UI. However, I found it a bit difficult to quickly hack it for my specific needs. They have excellent features for lots of different NLP tasks. In the end, I ended up drawing inspiration from their UI and building my own tool.\nArgilla: This platform has lots of functionality, however the LLM functionality fell short for me. I couldn’t do simple things like sorting, filtering, and labeling. Their LLM vs non-LLM functionality has very different APIs, which makes things quite fragmented at the moment. I think it could have potential once it matures.\nLilac: I found that this was more of a dataset viewer rather than something that allowed me to label data and curate it. So it didn’t really fit my needs. The user interface did not seem that hackable/extendable.\n\nOne thing that became clear to me while trying these vendors is the importance of being able to hack these tools to fit your specific needs. Every company you work with will have an idiosyncratic tech stack and tools that you might want to integrate into this data annotation tool. This led me to build my own tools using general-purpose frameworks.\n\n\nGeneral Purpose Frameworks\nPython has really great front-end frameworks that are easy to use like Gradio or Panel and Streamlit. There is a new kid on the block, Shiny For Python, was my favorite after evaluating all of them.\nReasons I liked Shiny the most:\n\nNative integration with Quarto.\nA powerful reactive model that is snappy.\nA small API that is easy to learn and keep in your head.\nAmazing WASM support, for example I have embedded a version of the app in this blog post!\n\nI found that Shiny apps always required much less code and were easier to understand than the other frameworks.",

(It can also be useful to hijack these loaders to acquire data for fine tuning!)\nFor example, if you are trying to get data from a website as text here are some useful DocumentLoaders:\nI think it is useful to combine LangChain DocumentLoaders with HuggingFace datasets, because it allows you to save, version and do other fun things like perform semantic search of your data with FAISS.\nAs of this writing, there are over 125 different kinds of DocumentLoaders.

We hope to do this in several dimensions:\\n\\nCreate a writing and publishing environment with great integrated tools for technical content. We want to make authoring with embedded code, equations, figures, complex diagrams, interactive widgets, citations, cross references, and the myriad other special requirements of scientific discourse straightforward and productive for everyone.\\nHelp authors take full advantage of the web as a connected, interactive platform for communications, while still providing the ability to create excellent printed output from the same document source. Researchers shouldn’t need to choose between LaTeX, MS Word, and HTML but rather be able to author documents that target all of them at the same time.\\nMake reproducible research and publications the norm rather than the exception. Reproducibility requires that the code and data required to create a manuscript are an integrated part of it. However, this isn’t often straightforward in practice—Quarto aims to make it easier to adopt a reproducible workflow than not.\\n\\nQuarto is open source software licensed under the GNU GPL v2. We believe that it’s better for everyone if the tools used for research and science are free and open. Reproducibility, widespread sharing of knowledge and techniques, and the leveling of the playing field by eliminating cost barriers are but a few of the shared benefits of free software in science.\\n\\n\\nProject\\nAt the core of Quarto is Pandoc, a powerful and flexible document processing tool. Quarto adds a number of facilities to Pandoc aimed at scientific and technical publishing, including:\\n\\nEmbedding code and output from Python, R, and JavaScript via integration with Jupyter, Knitr, and Observable.\\nA variety of extensions to Pandoc markdown useful for technical writing including cross-references, sub-figures, layout panels, hoverable citations and footnotes, callouts, and more.\\nA project system for rendering groups of documents at once, sharing options across documents, and producing aggregate output like websites and books.\\n\\nDevelopment of Quarto is sponsored by Posit, PBC, where we previously created a similar system (R Markdown) that shared the same goals, but was targeted principally at users of the R language.

Below, I test throughput for Llama v2 7b on 1, 2, and 4 GPUs. The throughput is measured by passsing these 59 prompts to llm.generate. llm.generate is described in the vLLM documentation:\n\nCall llm.generate to generate the outputs. It adds the input prompts to vLLM engine’s waiting queue and executes the vLLM engine to generate the outputs with high throughput.\n\nHere are the results, averaged over 5 runs for each row:\nYou can see all the individual runs here. In my experiments, the 70b model needed a minimum of 4 A100s to run, so that’s why there is only one row for that model (Modal only has instances with 1, 2, or 4 GPUs).\n```{python}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo Not Compare To Latency Benchmark\n\n\n\nThe tok/sec number you see here is VERY different than the latency benchmark shown on this note. This particular benchmark maximizes throughput by running multiple requests in parallel. The previous latency benchmark measures the time it takes to process a single request.\n\n\n\nObservations\n\nA100s are much faster than A10s, but A10s are significantly cheaper.1\nOn A10s, scaling up to more GPUs increases throughput at first, but then seems to diminish. It appears like there is a Goldilocks zone in terms of the right number of GPUs to maximize throughput. I did not explore this in detail, as Modal only has instances with specific numbers of GPUs.2\nThe much larger Llama v2 70b model is only ~2x slower than its 7b counterpart.",

I recommend going to their discord with questions.\nPytorch currently feels like a second class citizen (but may not be for long).\n\nYou have to do many more steps to potentially load a Pytorch model vs. TF, and those steps are not clear.1\nHowever, I’ve heard from the team that they plan on investing heavily in Pytorch, even more so than Tensorflow.\n\nI’m not sure why they led with BERT/Tensorflow examples. I would like to see paved paths for modern LLMs like Llama or Mistral. Keep an eye on this repo for examples as these will be added soon.\nModel compilation and loading took 5 minutes. A progress bar for compilation would be really helpful.\nTorchscript as a serialization format is older and in maintenance mode compared to more recent torch.compile or torch.export but Max doesn’t support that yet. Discussion is here. You will probably have better luck with LLMs by first exporting models to ONNX via Optimum.\nPrinting the model is not informative, like it is when you print a torch model (doesn’t show you all the layers and shapes).\nWe couldn’t quite understand the output of the model and we eventually hypothesized that torch.script is not the right serialization path for Mistral, but we aren’t sure. I think users may get confused by this.\nMax currently targets CPUs rather than GPUs. I am not concerned by this as the roadmap points to GPUs coming soon. I’m hoping that the team can make AMD GPUs fly so we can break the hegemony of Nvidia.\n\nI’m optimistic that these papercuts will be resolved soon. I’m pretty bullish on the talent level of the team working on these things.",

    "text": "Attempting To Load Mistral In The Max Engine\nToday, the Modular team released the Max Inference Engine:\n\nMAX Engine is a next-generation compiler and runtime system for neural network graphs. It supercharges the execution of AI models in any format (including TensorFlow, PyTorch, and ONNX), on a wide variety of hardware. MAX Engine also allows you to extend these models with custom ops that MAX Engine can analyze and optimize with other ops in the graph.\n\nThese docs show how to load a TensorFlow model, but I want to load a pytorch LLM like Mistral-7b. I documented my attempt at doing so here.\n\n1. Serialize Model as Torchscript\nIn order to load your model in the Max engine we must serialize the model as torchscript. We can do this by tracing the model graph and then using torch.jit.save to save the model.\n\nimport time\nfrom functools import partial\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\nimport torch\n\n# load model artifacts from the hub\nhf_path=\"mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1\"\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(hf_path,torchscript=True)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(hf_path)\ntokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token\n\n# trace the model and save it with torchscript\nmax_seq_len=128\nmodel_path=\"mistral.pt\"\ntext = \"This is text to be used for tracing\"\n# I'm setting the arguments for tokenizer once so I can reuse it later (they need to be consistent)\nmax_tokenizer = partial(tokenizer, return_tensors=\"pt\",padding=\"max_length\", max_length=max_seq_len)\ninputs = max_tokenizer(text)\ntraced_model = torch.jit.trace(model, [inputs['input_ids'], inputs['attention_mask']])\ntorch.jit.save(traced_model, model_path)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Specify Input Shape\nHaving a set input shape is required for compilation.\nThis next bit is from This code. Apparently there is a way to specify dynamic values for the sequence len and batch size, but we couldn’t figure that out easily from the docs.\n\nfrom max import engine\ninput_spec_list = [\n    engine.TorchInputSpec(shape=tensor.size(), dtype=engine.DType.int64)\n    for tensor in inputs.values()\n]\noptions = engine.TorchLoadOptions(input_spec_list)\n\n\n\n3. Compile and Load Model\n\nstart_time = time.time()\nsession = engine.InferenceSession()\nmodel = session.load(model_path, options)\n\nend_time = time.time()\n\nWow! The model takes ~5 minutes to compile and load. Subsequent compilations are faster, but NOT if I restart the Jupyter Kernel.\n\nelapsed_time = end_time - start_time\nprint(f\"Elapsed time: {elapsed_time} seconds\")\n\nElapsed time: 371.86387610435486 seconds\n\n\n\n\n4. Inference\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe failed to get this to work\n\n\n\nEven though we could call model.execute the outputs we got didn’t make much sense to us, even after some investigation. Our hypothesis is that execute is not calling model.generate. But this is where we gave up.\n\n\nBe sure to set return_token_type_ids=False, note that I’m using the same arguments for padding and max_length that I used for tracing the model (because I’m using the max_tokenizer which I defined) so the shape is consistent.\n\nINPUT=\"Why did the chicken cross the road?\"\ninp = max_tokenizer(INPUT, return_token_type_ids=False)\nout = model.execute(**inp)\n\nGet the token ids (predictions) and decode them:\n\npreds = out['result0'].argmax(axis=-1)\n\nWe tried to debug this but could not figure out what was wrong, so we gave up here. We aren’t sure why the output looks like this. See what the output is supposed to look like in this section.\n(Scroll to the right to see the full output)\n\n' '.join(tokenizer.batch_decode(preds, skip_special_tokens=False))\n\n'ммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммммм # do you chicken cross the road?\\n'\n\n\nWe were intrigued by the M and Mark joked that it is some interesting illuminati secret code injected into the model for (i.e. M for Modular) which I thought was funny :)\nOur theory is that torchscript is not the right way to serialize this model and this is some kind of silent failure, but it is hard to know.",

    "text": "Impressions\n\nModel serving frameworks (TF Serving, TorchServe, etc) are probably the way to go for production / enterprise deployments, especially for larger models. They offer more features, and latency will be more predictable (even if slower). I think that for smaller models (&lt; 200MB) FastAPI is fine.\nIt is super easy to get started with FastAPI.\nI was able to confirm Sayak’s Benchmark where FastAPI is faster than TF Serving, but also less consistent overall. FastAPI is also more likely to fail, although I haven’t been able to cause that. In my experiments FastAPI was much faster for this small model, but this could change with larger models.\nMemory is consumed linearly as you increase the number of Uvicorn workers. Model serving frameworks like TF-Serving seem to work more efficiently. You should be careful to set the environment variable TF_FORCE_GPU_ALLOW_GROWTH=true if you are running inference on GPUs. I think in many cases you would be doing inference on CPUs, so this might not be relevant most of the time.\nFastAPI seems like it could be really nice on smaller models and scoped hardware where there is only one worker per node and you load balance across nodes (because you aren’t replicating the model with each worker).\nDebugging FastAPI is amazing, as its pure python and you get a nice docs page at http://&lt;IP&gt;/docs that lets you test out your endpoints right on the page! The documentation for FastPI is also amazing.\nIf you want the request parameters to be sent in the body (as you often do with ML b/c you want to send data to be scored), you have to use Pydantic. This is very opinionated, but easy enough to use.",

Apparently it can take time and lots of experiments to get right. Follow this guide for more information. This is a topic I may revisit in the future.\n\n\nAccording to the docs:\n\nModel Server has the ability to batch requests in a variety of settings in order to realize better throughput. The scheduling for this batching is done globally for all models and model versions on the server to ensure the best possible utilization of the underlying resources no matter how many models or model versions are currently being served by the server. You can enable this by using the --enable_batching flag and control it with the --batching_parameters_file.\n\nThis is an example batching parameters file:\n\n%%writefile batch-config.cfg\nmax_batch_size { value: 1000 }\nbatch_timeout_micros { value: 1000 }\nmax_enqueued_batches { value: 16 }\nnum_batch_threads { value: 16 }\n\nOverwriting batch-config.cfg\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidance on batch configuration\n\n\n\nGuidance for these config files are here there is no “right answer”. For GPUs, the guidance is this:\nGPU: One Approach\nIf your model uses a GPU device for part or all of your its inference work, consider the following approach:\n\nSet num_batch_threads to the number of CPU cores.\nTemporarily set batch_timeout_micros to a really high value while you tune max_batch_size to achieve the desired balance between throughput and average latency. Consider values in the hundreds or thousands.\nFor online serving, tune batch_timeout_micros to rein in tail latency. The idea is that batches normally get filled to max_batch_size, but occasionally when there is a lapse in incoming requests, to avoid introducing a latency spike it makes sense to process whatever’s in the queue even if it represents an underfull batch. The best value for batch_timeout_micros is typically a few milliseconds, and depends on your context and goals. Zero is a value to consider; it works well for some workloads. (For bulk processing jobs, choose a large value, perhaps a few seconds, to ensure good throughput but not wait too long for the final (and likely underfull) batch.)",

    "text": "Network Policies\nK8s have a flat networking model, which means that all pods can communicate with each other. To prevent this, we can use network policies. Network policies are like firewall rules that allow or deny traffic to pods. Network policies are applied to pods using labels. This can be used to block incoming and outgoing traffic.\nOutgoing traffic is referred to as egress and incoming traffic is referred to as ingress, which should not be confused with the ingress resource.\nFor example, the below network policy will only allow traffic to pods labeled app: apod-api from pods labeled app: apod-web:\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: NetworkPolicy\nmetadata:\n name: apod-api\nspec:\n podSelector:             # This is the Pod where the rule applies.\n   matchLabels:\n     app: apod-api       \n ingress:                 # Rules default to deny, so this rule\n - from:                  # denies all ingress except where the \n   - podSelector:         # source of the traffic is a Pod with \n       matchLabels:       # the apod-web label.\n         app: apod-web\n   ports:                 # This restriction is by port.\n   - port: api            # The port is named in the API Pod spec.\nHowever this doesn’t do anything! Just like you need an ingress controller, you need something in your cluster’s networking system to enforce this. This involves installing various plugins, which your DevOps team should be doing. Furthermore, different cloud platforms make this easier or harder.",

    "section": "Load Balancers vs Ingress",
    "text": "Load Balancers vs Ingress\nLoad balancers are an easy way to expose apps, however Ingress is yet a different way that is more suited to HTTP requests. Here are some key differences:\n\nLoad Balancers can accept any kind of traffic (TCP, UDP, etc).\nCloud Kubernetes platforms like AKS and EKS are highly available multinode clusters. Deploying a Kubernetes LoadBalancer Service creates an actual load balancer in your cloud, which spans all the nodes in your cluster—the cloud load balancer sends incoming traffic to one of the nodes and then Kubernetes routes it to a Pod. You’ll get a different IP address for each LoadBalancer Service, and it will be a public address, accessible from the internet. What this means is that a LoadBalancer will spin up additional resources on your cloud provider. This doesn’t have to be the case with Ingress.\nCloud providers often charge based on “load balancing rules”, which roughly translates into how many load balancing external IP addresses are assigned. By using an ingress to combine several services into one, rather than each being exposed with it’s own IP, you can likely save money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocker Desktop\n\n\n\nDocker Desktop’s local Kubernetes runs on a single machine and integrates with the network stack so LoadBalancer Services are available at the localhost address.",

    "text": "Ingress\nFor HTTPS, Ingress is the preferred way to expose your apps. You can have multiple services exposed on one host, whereas you cannot do that with a LoadBalancer. Ingress allows you to route requests based on the URL path. Ingress allows you to make changes to your services without changing the address to the end user (ex: if you want different url paths to now go to different services).\n\nIngress Controller\nAn Ingress controller is responsible for fulfilling the Ingress, usually with a load balancer.\nThe Ingress Resource doesn’t do anything by itself; you need an ingress controller which does the work of routing requests. The ingress controller often contains a reverse proxy like Nginx. When you set this up on cloud providers they may offer something a bitt different. Reverse proxies intercept requests and route them to where they need to go. These reverse proxies can also do other things like caching, load balancing, URL rewrites, and so on. There are lots of flavors of Ingress Resources (like Nginx, Traefik, etc).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCloud providers give you an Ingress controller\n\n\n\nIf you’re using a managed cluster with one of the major cloud providers, an ingress controller is already in place. In Google Kubernetes Engine, the ingress controller is GLBC (GCE L7 Load Balancer), in AWS the Ingress functionality is provided by the AWS Load Balancer Controller, while Azure provides AGIC (Application Gateway Ingress Controller).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat is a reverse proxy?\n\n\n\nReverse proxies intercept incoming web requests and can take different actions, such as rewriting the URL (changing the path), or routing different paths to different places. They can also provide security by blocking or ignoring certain requests and caching results. For these reasons, reverse proxies are a must-have for any production web application.\nReverse proxies are different than proxy servers. Proxy servers forward traffic from a requestor/client – “outbound traffic”. Reverse proxies intercept client requests and forward them to the server – “inbound traffic”. For example, proxy servers can hide the identity of the client. Reverse proxies can hide the identity of the server.\n\n\n\n\nIf you do not go with your cloud provider’s hosted K8s solution with a provided ingress controller, an experienced devops person will setup the ingress for you. Your DevOps team should deploy an Ingress controller for you. Your DevOps team should provide you with a template for the Ingress Resource, which may reference the Ingress controller. The important part is that you are comfortable enough to know what it is doing to modify an Ingress Resource template. You should not have to create an Ingress Resource from scratch.\nIn the below example, our Ingress controller is a load balancer that is also running Nginx. Below is the Service and the Deployment parts of the Ingress Controller to give you an idea that the controller itself is a LoadBalancer. The Deployment is a Deployment of the Nginx reverse proxy. The Service is a LoadBalancer Service that exposes the Nginx reverse proxy.

Note that the path is one type of common configuration, and controller-specific options are specified via annotations (in the second example).\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: timeserver-ingress\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: timeserver-internal\n            port:\n              number: 80\n      - path: /robohash\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: robohash-internal\n            port:\n              number: 80\nAnother example of an ingress:\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: hello-kiamol\n  annotations: # this was added b/c of this https://github.com/sixeyed/kiamol/issues/32\n    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: \"nginx\" \n  labels:\n    kiamol: ch15\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: hello-kiamol\n            port:\n              number: 80\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIngress Annotations\n\n\n\nAn ingress template should be provided to you by a DevOps engineer. You should not need to create one from scratch. This should vary from company to company. The annotations are special parameters passed along to the controller since the Ingress Resource spec is very minimal in the options it can take and because Ingress controllers have different capabilities. The annotations are controller-specific.\n\n\nYou can also have several hosts in the same ingress:\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: timeserver-ingress\nspec:\n  rules:\n  - host: timeserver.example.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: timeserver-internal\n            port:\n              number: 80\n  - host: robohash.example.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: robohash-internal\n            port:\n              number: 80\nBy using host-based routing, you can host several services all with the same external IP address. The ingress inspects the Host header in the HTTP request, and routes traffic accordingly. This contrast with Services of type LoadBalancer which each get their own IP address assigned and perform no packet inspection or routing.\nIt is worth reading the docs on Path types and what happens when there are multiple matches.\n\n\nDefault Backend\nYou can direct anything that doesn’t match any of the rules to a generic 404 page by specifying a default backend:\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: kiada\nspec:\n  defaultBackend:\n    service:\n      name: fun404\n      port:\n        name: http\n  rules:\n  ...\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: fun404\n  labels:\n    app: fun404\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: server\n    image: luksa/static-http-server\n    args:\n    - --listen-port=8080\n    - --response-code=404\n    - --text=This isn't the URL you're looking for.\n    ports:\n    - name: http\n      containerPort: 8080\n---\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: fun404\n  labels:\n    app: fun404\nspec:\n  selector:\n    app: fun404\n  ports:\n  - name: http\n    port: 80\n    targetPort: http",

This is very common when the cluster is running in the cloud. If the address isn’t displayed after several minutes, it means that no ingress controller has processed the Ingress object. Check if the controller is running. Since a cluster can run multiple ingress controllers, it’s possible that they’ll all ignore your Ingress object if you don’t specify which of them should process it.

    "section": "TLS / HTTPS Encryption",
    "text": "TLS / HTTPS Encryption\nTLS: Transport Layer Security, formerly known as SSL or Secure Sockets Layer.\n\nHow Does HTTPS Work?\nHTTPS uses the HTTP protocol with TLS and SSL encryption added on top. The initial handshake uses asymmetric encryption and then further communication happens with symmetric encryption. This is how it works:\n\nA website references an SSL Certificate that contains a public key. The SSL Certificate is provided by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).\n\nYou can check the authenticity of the certificate by using a separate public key from the CA to decrypt the CA’s signature (the CA has their own private key to encrypt its digital signature). Your browser has a list of trusted CAs. Your browser often gets these from other trusted sources like your operating system.\n\nChrome Root CA Policy, 2022-09-01 “When making HTTPS connections, Chrome refers to a list of root certificates from CAs that have demonstrated why continued trust in them is justified. This list is known as a “Root Store.” CA certificates included in the Chrome Root Store are selected on the basis of publicly available and verified information, such as that within the Common CA Database (CCADB), and ongoing reviews by the Chrome Root Program. CCADB is a datastore run by Mozilla and used by various operating systems, browser vendors, and CA owners to share and disclose information regarding the ownership, historical operation, and audit history of CAs and corresponding certificates and key material. Historically, Chrome has integrated with the Root Store provided by the platform on which it is running. In Chrome 105, Chrome began a platform-by-platform transition from relying on the host operating system’s Root Store to its own on Windows, macOS, ChromeOS, Linux, and Android. This change makes Chrome more secure and promotes consistent user and developer experiences across platforms. Apple policies prevent the Chrome Root Store and corresponding Chrome Certificate Verifier from being used on Chrome for iOS.”\n\nThese CAs come from trustworthy sources like Cloudflare, Google, etc.\nLet’s Encrypt, a popular CA checks that the certificate request comes from a person who actually controls the domain. They do this by sending the client a unique token and then Lets Encrypt makes a web or DNS request to retrieve a key derived from that token.\n\nAfter the initial verification and handshake, the client and server use a symmetric encryption key to communicate securely. The client and server both have the same symmetric key. This is the key that is used to encrypt and decrypt the data.\n\nSee this article and also this one\n\n\nTLS Termination and HTTPS\nSome Ingress controllers like Trafefik have integrations with Let’s Encrypt to automate the entire process of getting a certificate and renewing it. They also handle TLS termination, which is decrypting the traffic and forwarding it on the appropriate place. Ingress is a nice place to handle TLS because it allows you to have a standardized way of handling TLS for all your services.\nThese ingress controllers allow you to specify a secret that contains the TLS certificate and private key, and they will handle the rest. All you need to do is add a TLS section to your Ingress spec and state the name of the Secret to use:\nFirst you need to create a secret (ideally you would never create a certificate like this, but this is just for demo purposes)\n# create a Secret:\n$ openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout example.key -out example.crt \\\n  -sha256 -days 7300 -nodes \\\n  -subj '/CN=*.example.com' \\\n  -addext 'subjectAltName = DNS:*.example.com' \n \n$ kubectl create secret tls tls-example-com --cert=example.crt --key=example.key\nsecret/tls-example-com created\nThen reference the secret from the Ingress spec:\non: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: kiada\nspec:\n  tls:\n  - secretName: tls-example-com\n    hosts:\n    - \"*.example.com\" # The hosts specified in tls.hosts must match the names used in the certificate in the secret.\n  rules:\n  ...",

Doing so will limit you, as you want to be able to scale/upgrade etc these different components independently.\nThere are two patterns:\n\n[[Sidecar]] runs alongside; pod isn’t considered ready until all the containers are ready. This is what is shown above.\n[Init containers] you can have multiple init containers, they run in sequence, in order they are specified. Each must complete sucessfully before next one starts, and all must complete sucessfully before the Pod containers start (if mulitple they are sidecars)\n\nInit containers are often used to generate data for container Pods (which is written to a shared mounted directory as previously shown). An example is an init container w/ the git command line installed that clones a repo to a shared file system. Another example is to write configuration files in a specific format that your app expects from env variables and config maps.\nThe below YAML shows the initContainer craeating the index.html file so the next imge can serve it.\n% cat sleep/sleep-with-html-server.yaml                                                                                              \napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n...\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: sleep\n  template:\n...\n    spec:\n      initContainers:\n        - name: init-html\n          image: kiamol/ch03-sleep\n          command: ['sh', '-c', \"echo '&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;h1&gt;KIAMOL Ch07&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;' &gt; /data/index.html\"]\n          volumeMounts:\n            - name: data\n              mountPath: /data\n      containers:\n        - name: sleep\n          image: kiamol/ch03-sleep\n        - name: server\n          image: kiamol/ch03-sleep\n          command: ['sh', '-c', 'while true; do echo -e \"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\\nContent-Type: text/html\\nContent-Length: 62\\n\\n$(cat /data-ro/index.html)\" | nc -l -p 8080; done']\n          ports:\n            - containerPort: 8080\n              name: http\n          volumeMounts:\n            - name: data\n              mountPath: /data-ro\n              readOnly: true\nHere is an example that writes a config file callled appsettings.json:\n...\n    spec:\n      initContainers:\n        - name: init-config\n          image: kiamol/ch03-sleep\n          command: ['sh', '-c', \"cat /config-in/appsettings.json | jq --arg APP_ENV \\\"$APP_ENVIRONMENT\\\" '.Application.Environment=$APP_ENV' &gt; /config-out/appsettings.json\"]\n          env:\n          - name: APP_ENVIRONMENT\n            value: TEST\n          volumeMounts:\n            - name: config-map\n              mountPath: /config-in\n            - name: config-dir\n              mountPath: /config-out\n...\n      volumes:\n        - name: config-map     # this is a volume that is mounted as input\n          configMap:\n            name: timecheck-config\n        - name: config-dir     # files are written out here\n          emptyDir: {}",

    "text": "Hamel: you probably don’t need this. JUST SKIP THESE NOTES\n\n[[StatefulSet]] is a Pod controller, just like [[5. ReplicaSets]] or [[DaemonSets]]\nWhen you deploy a StatefulSet, it creates Pods with predictable names, which can be individually accessed over DNS, and starts them in order; the first Pod needs to be up and running before the second Pod is created.\nIf you are trying to model database on K8s, you might use StatefulSet. However, don’t put DBs on K8s - use a managed service for that instead. StatefulSet just gives you determinstic Pod names and networking, you have to take care of synching your apps yourself. That would be outside the scope of what DS should do IMO.\nHere is kind: StatefulSet\n % cat todo-list/db/todo-db.yaml                                                                                                      \napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: StatefulSet\nmetadata:\n  name: todo-db\n  labels:\n    kiamol: ch08\nspec:\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      app: todo-db\n  serviceName: todo-db\n  replicas: 2\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        app: todo-db\nWhen you get pods, they will be incremented from 0, this allows you network/communicate with them deterministically.\n% kl get po                                                                                                                         \nNAME        READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\ntodo-db-0   1/1     Running   0          23s\ntodo-db-1   1/1     Running   0          21s\nStatefulSet is a controller, so if you delete a pod the StatefulSet will recreate it.\n\nInitContainers\nYou can bootstrap pods with initcontainers and stateful sets. For example.\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: StatefulSet\n...\n      initContainers:\n        - name: wait-service\n          image: kiamol/ch03-sleep\n          envFrom:\n          - configMapRef:\n              name: todo-db-env\n          command: ['/scripts/wait-service.sh']\nThe script says if its running in Pod 0 do nothing, but if its running in Pod 1 then replicate the master. This is just an idea, you probably should never do this yourself.\n\n\nNetworking In StatefulSets\nYou need to have a special configuration “headless Service” to setup newtworking for StatefulSets, by setting ClusterIP: None\n%cat todo-list/db/todo-db-service.yaml                                                                                              \napiVersion: v1\nkind: Service\nmetadata:\n  name: todo-db\n  labels:\n    kiamol: ch08\nspec:\n  ports:                  # 5432 is the port Postgres uses\n    - port: 5432\n      targetPort: 5432 \n      name: postgres\n  selector:\n    app: todo-db\n  clusterIP: None             # Note how this is None\nThe pod will be reachable at pod-name.service-name.cluster-domain-suffix. for example:\ntodo-db-0.todo-db.default.svc.cluster.local\nSee: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/#stable-network-id\n\nA StatefulSet can use a Headless Service to control the domain of its Pods. The domain managed by this Service takes the form: \\((service name).\\)(namespace).svc.cluster.local, where “cluster.local” is the cluster domain. As each Pod is created, it gets a matching DNS subdomain, taking the form: \\((podname).\\)(governing service domain), where the governing service is defined by the serviceName field on the StatefulSet.\n\nThis is also related to the serviceName field on the StatefulSet\nYou can lookup the cluster-domain-suffix like this :\nkl exec deploy/sleep -- sh -c 'nslookup todo-db'`\nThe headless service still does load balancing, but lets you access the Pod\n\n\nStorage\nFor DBs you want each pod to have its own persistent disk, there is a shortcut: using volumeClaimTemplates which makes sure each Pod in the stateful set always gets its own persistent volume.\n% cat sleep/sleep-with-pvc.yaml                                             \n...\nkind: StatefulSet\n  template:\n    ...\n  volumeClaimTemplates:\n  - metadata:\n      name: data\n      labels:\n        kiamol: ch08\n    spec:\n      accessModes:\n       - ReadWriteOnce\n      resources:\n        requests:\n          storage: 5Mi\nEach pod will get a PVC created dynamically, which will create a Persistent Volume using the default storage class (or the requested storage class if included in the spec).\nThe link b/w each pod and its PVC is maintained when pods are replaced. For example:\n# create a file\nkl exec sleep-with-pvc-0 -- sh -c 'echo pod 0 &gt; /data/pod.txt'\n\n#delete the pod\nkl delete po sleep-with-pvc-0\n\n# this will show the right contents\nkl exec sleep-with-pvc-0 -- cat /data/pod.txt",

There is also cluster scaling which adds and removes nodes, but your cloud platform can do that.\nK8s needs to have a way to measure the load on the pods, this can vary on cloud platforms so check the appropriate documentation. Generally, K8s comes with a metric-server component that can measure basic things like CPU and memory usage, which you can see with the kubectl top command. The metrics.k8s.io API is usually provided by an add-on named Metrics Server, which needs to be launched separately.

    "text": "Taint\nTaints are a special kind of label with a key-value pair, but it tells the scheduler that a particular node is different. For example, the master taint is applied to control plane nodes by default (so your applications will not get scheduled on this important node).\nYou can use taint to record relevant attributes about nodes, like the type of hardware. When you add a taint, workloads will not be scheduled on that node unless you add a matching toleration to the workload.\nFor example, nothing will be scheduled if you add this taint to all nodes! Note that tainting doesn’t impact existing workloads, only future ones.\nkubectl taint nodes --all kiamol-disk=hdd:NoSchedule\nThis is how you would add the toleration to a workload:\nspec:                           # The Pod spec in a Deployment\n containers:\n   - name: sleep\n     image: kiamol/ch03-sleep      \n tolerations:                  # Lists taints this Pod is happy with\n     - key: \"kiamol-disk\"      # The key, value, and effect all need \n       operator: \"Equal\"       # to match the taint on the node.\n       value: \"hdd\"\n       effect: \"NoSchedule\"\nThe effect can be these three types: 1. NoSchedule - The Pod will not be scheduled on the node. 2. PreferNoSchedule - The scheduler will try to avoid scheduling the Pod on the node. 3. NoExecute - The Pod will not be scheduled on the node and any existing Pods on the node will be evicted. This taint is retroactive, meaning that it will effect existing Pods as well as new ones (this is different to the other two).\nSee this article for more info.\nYou can add a taint label to a node like this:\n% kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule\n\n#remove the taint like This\n% kubectl taint nodes node1 key1=value1:NoSchedule-\nTaints are only for negative associations - you can’t use them to say, “this node is good for this workload”. For that, you need to use nodeSelector or nodeAffinity. You would not use a taint so say a workload should run on a GPU node, for example.",

For example, on my laptop if I do kl get nodes -o yaml it will have the key,value pair architecture: arm64 under nodeInfo.\nNode selectors ensure that apps run only on nodes with specific label values, but you usually want some more flexibility than a straight equality match. A finer level of control comes with affinity and antiaffinity.\nHere is another example of using nodeSelector:\nFirst, label your nodes:\n# see list of nodes w/names\n% kubectl get nodes --show-labels\n\n# apply a label to a node\n% kubectl label nodes &lt;your-node-name&gt; disktype=ssd\nThen, add the nodeSelector to your config:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: nginx\n  labels:\n    env: test\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: nginx\n    image: nginx\n    imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent\n  nodeSelector:\n    disktype: ssd",

    "section": "Affinity",
    "text": "Affinity\nUnlike taint this is a positive association between a pod and a node. Affinity uses a node selector but with a match expression rather than equality. There is two kinds:\n\nrequiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: The scheduler can’t schedule the Pod unless the rule is met. This functions like nodeSelector, but with a more expressive syntax.\npreferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: The scheduler will try to meet the rule. If a matching node is not available, the Pod will still be scheduled.\n\nYou can constrain a Pod using labels on other Pods running on the node (or other topological domain), instead of just node labels, which allows you to define rules for which Pods can be co-located on a node.\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: with-node-affinity\nspec:\n  affinity:\n    nodeAffinity:\n      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:\n        nodeSelectorTerms:\n        - matchExpressions:\n          - key: topology.kubernetes.io/zone\n            operator: In\n            values:\n            - antarctica-east1\n            - antarctica-west1\n      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:\n      - weight: 1\n        preference:\n          matchExpressions:\n          - key: another-node-label-key\n            operator: In\n            values:\n            - another-node-label-value\n  containers:\n  - name: with-node-affinity\n    image: registry.k8s.io/pause:2.0\nIn this example, the following rules apply:\n\nThe node must have a label with the key topology.kubernetes.io/zone and the value of that label must be either antarctica-east1 or antarctica-west1.\nThe node preferably has a label with the key another-node-label-key and the value another-node-label-value.\n\nThe operator used above is In, but it can also be In, NotIn, Exists, DoesNotExist, Gt and Lt.\nThe NotIn and DoesNotExist allow you to define antiaffinity rules. For example, you could say “don’t schedule this pod on a node that already has a pod with this label”. You could also use taints for this as well.\n\nAffinity Weight\nFor preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution scheduling, you can set a weight b/w 1-100. The scheduler adds all the weights of all the preferred rules and adds that to the score when making a scheduling decision.\nExample of two different weights:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: with-affinity-anti-affinity\nspec:\n  affinity:\n    nodeAffinity:\n      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:\n        nodeSelectorTerms:\n        - matchExpressions:\n          - key: kubernetes.io/os\n            operator: In\n            values:\n            - linux     # The Node MUST have the label `kubernetes.io/os=linux`\n      preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:\n      - weight: 1\n        preference:\n          matchExpressions:\n          - key: label-1\n            operator: In\n            values:\n            - key-1\n      - weight: 50\n        preference:\n          matchExpressions:\n          - key: label-2\n            operator: In\n            values:\n            - key-2\n  containers:\n  - name: with-node-affinity\n    image: registry.k8s.io/pause:2.0",

    "text": "Improving the model\n\nLearning Rate Finder\nStart with a very, very small learning rate, something so small that we would never expect it to be too big to handle. We use that for one mini-batch, find what the losses are afterwards, and then increase the learning rate by some percentage (e.g., doubling it each time). Then we do another mini-batch, track the loss, and double the learning rate again. We keep doing this until the loss gets worse, instead of better. This is the point where we know we have gone too far. We then select a learning rate a bit lower than this point. Our advice is to pick either:\n\nOne order of magnitude less than where the minimum loss was achieved (i.e., the minimum divided by 10)\nThe last point where the loss was clearly decreasing\n\nThe learning rate finder computes those points and more on the curve to help you. Additional learning rate suggestion algorithms can be passed into the function, by default only the valley paradigm is used. The learning rate finder can be called with learn.lr_find:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; learn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; lr_min, lr_steep, lr_valley, lr_slide = learn.lr_find(suggest_funcs=(minimum, steep, valley, slide))\n\nThe default valley hueristic works just fine. Note, you will want to re-run this anytime you change your model such as unfreeze layers. You might want to run this periodically if you are checkpointing during training.\n\n\nFine Tuning models\nWhen we create a model from a pretrained network fastai automatically freezes all of the pretrained layers for us. When we call the fine_tune method fastai does two things:\n\nTrains the randomly added layers for one epoch, with all other layers frozen\nUnfreezes all of the layers, and trains them all for the number of epochs requested\n\nAlthough this is a reasonable default approach, it is likely that for your particular dataset you may get better results by doing things slightly differently. The fine_tune method has a number of parameters you can use to change its behavior, but it might be easiest for you to just call the underlying methods directly if you want to get some custom behavior.\nfit_one_cycle is the suggested way to train models without using fine_tune. We’ll see why later in the book; in short, what fit_one_cycle does is to start training at a low learning rate, gradually increase it for the first section of training, and then gradually decrease it again for the last section of training.\nlearn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(3, 3e-3) # train the head\nlearn.unfreeze() # unfreeze everything\nlearn.lr_find() # find new lr after unfreezing\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(6, lr_max=1e-5) #fine tune it all\n\n\nDiscriminative Learning Rates\nOne important aspect of fine tuning is discriminative learning rates: use a lower learning rate for the early layers of the neural network, and a higher learning rate for the later layers (and especially the randomly added layers).\nfastai lets you pass a Python slice object anywhere that a learning rate is expected. The first value passed will be the learning rate in the earliest layer of the neural network, and the second value will be the learning rate in the final layer. The layers in between will have learning rates that are multiplicatively equidistant throughout that range. Let’s use this approach to replicate the previous training, but this time we’ll only set the lowest layer of our net to a learning rate of 1e-6; the other layers will scale up to 1e-4. Let’s train for a while and see what happens:\nlearn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet34, metrics=error_rate)\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(3, 3e-3)\nlearn.unfreeze()\nlearn.fit_one_cycle(12, lr_max=slice(1e-6,1e-4))\nWe can accomplish everything we did above by calling fine_tune instead. fine_tune will automatically apply discriminative learning rates for you:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; learn.fine_tune??\nSignature:\nlearn.fine_tune(\n    epochs,\n    base_lr=0.002,\n    freeze_epochs=1,\n    lr_mult=100,\n    pct_start=0.3,\n    div=5.0,\n    lr_max=None,\n    div_final=100000.0,\n    wd=None,\n    moms=None,\n    cbs=None,\n    reset_opt=False,\n)\nSource:   \n@patch\n@delegates(Learner.fit_one_cycle)\ndef fine_tune(self:Learner, epochs, base_lr=2e-3, freeze_epochs=1, lr_mult=100,\n              pct_start=0.3, div=5.0, **kwargs):\n    \"Fine tune with `Learner.freeze` for `freeze_epochs`, then with `Learner.unfreeze` for `epochs`, using discriminative LR.\"\n    self.freeze()\n    self.fit_one_cycle(freeze_epochs, slice(base_lr), pct_start=0.99, **kwargs)\n    base_lr /= 2\n    self.unfreeze()\n    self.fit_one_cycle(epochs, slice(base_lr/lr_mult, base_lr), pct_start=pct_start, div=div, **kwargs)\nFile:      ~/anaconda3/lib/python3.9/site-packages/fastai/callback/schedule.py\nType:      method",

    "text": "DataBlock API: Multi-Label Data\nLet’s say you have a Dataframe with filenames and multiple labels per filename. The best way to get started in to use the DataBlock api to construct Datasets and DataLoaders. A review of terminology:\n\nDataset: collection that returns a tuple of (x,y) for single item. Can do this with list(zip(x,y))\nDataLoader: an iterator that provides a stream of minibatches of (x,y) instead of a single item.\nDatasets: object that contains a training Dataset and a Validation dataset.\nDataLoaders: object that contains a training DataLoader and a validation DataLoader.\n\n\nCreating Datsets\nYou can use a DataBlock:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from fastbook import *\n&gt;&gt;&gt; from fastai.vision.all import *\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; path = untar_data(URLs.PASCAL_2007)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; df = pd.read_csv(path/'train.csv')\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def get_x(r): return path/'train'/r['fname']\n&gt;&gt;&gt; def get_y(r): return r['labels'].split(' ')\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dblock = DataBlock(get_x = get_x, get_y = get_y)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dsets = dblock.datasets(df)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dsets.train[0]\n\n(Path('/home/hamel/.fastai/data/pascal_2007/train/006162.jpg'), ['aeroplane'])\nNext we need to convert our images into tensors. We can do this by using the ImageBlock and MultiCategoryBlock:\n\n\nUsing Blocks For Transforms\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dblock = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock, MultiCategoryBlock),\n                       get_x = get_x, get_y = get_y)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dsets = dblock.datasets(df)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dsets.train[0]\n\n(PILImage mode=RGB size=500x333,\n TensorMultiCategory([0., 0., 1., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0., 0.]))\n\n\nInspecting Vocabulary\nYou can inspect the vocabulary with the vocab attribute:\ndsets.train.vocab\n\n\nUsing a splitter\nThe dataframe has a column called is_valid, we can use that do a train validation split. By default, the DataBlock uses a RandomSplitter. By default, RandomSplitter uses 20% of the data for the validation set.\ndef splitter(df):\n    train = df.index[~df['is_valid']].tolist()\n    valid = df.index[df['is_valid']].tolist()\n    return train,valid\n\ndblock = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock, MultiCategoryBlock),\n                   splitter=splitter,\n                   get_x=get_x, \n                   get_y=get_y)\n\ndsets = dblock.datasets(df)\n\n\nCreating DataLoaders\nDataLoaders build upon Datasets by streaming mini-batches instead of one example at a time. One prerequisite to making DataLoaders is that all the images are the same size. To do this you can use RandomResizedCrop:\ndblock = DataBlock(blocks=(ImageBlock, MultiCategoryBlock),\n                   splitter=splitter,\n                   get_x=get_x, \n                   get_y=get_y,\n                   item_tfms = RandomResizedCrop(128, min_scale=0.35))\ndls = dblock.dataloaders(df)\nWhen you are done with this, you want to debug things by calling show_batch:\ndls.show_batch(nrows=1, ncols=3)",

    "text": "Multi-Label Model\nYou can create a learner like so:\nlearn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18)\nOne useful thing is to debug / verify that the output shape conforms to what you are expecting. You can do this by running a tensor through your model and inspecting it’s output:\nx,y = to_cpu(dls.train.one_batch())\nactivs = learn.model(x)\nactivs.shape\n\nThis is what you would use to extract embeddings / activations out of another model\n\nIt’s a good idea to see what the activations look like:\n&gt;&gt;&gt; activs[0]\nTensorBase([ 2.0858,  2.8195,  0.0460,  1.7563,  3.3371,  2.4251,  2.3295, -2.8101,  3.3967, -3.2120,  3.3452, -2.3762, -0.3137, -4.6004,  0.7441, -2.6875,  0.0873, -0.2247, -3.1242,  3.6477],\n       grad_fn=&lt;AliasBackward0&gt;)\nWe can see these are not b/w 0 and 1, because the sigmoid has not been applied yet.\n\nLoss Functions\nPyTorch already provides this function for us. In fact, it provides a number of versions, with rather confusing names!\nF.binary_cross_entropy and its module equivalent nn.BCELoss calculate cross-entropy on a one-hot-encoded target, but do not include the initial sigmoid. Normally for one-hot-encoded targets you’ll want F.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits (or nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss), which do both sigmoid and binary cross-entropy in a single function, as in the preceding example.\nThe equivalent for single-label datasets (like MNIST or the Pet dataset), where the target is encoded as a single integer, is F.nll_loss or nn.NLLLoss for the version without the initial softmax, and F.cross_entropy or nn.CrossEntropyLoss for the version with the initial softmax.\nSince we have a one-hot-encoded target, we will use BCEWithLogitsLoss:\nloss_func = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss()\nloss = loss_func(activs, y)\nWe don’t actually need to tell fastai to use this loss function (although we can if we want) since it will be automatically chosen for us. fastai knows that the DataLoaders has multiple category labels, so it will use nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss by default.\n\n\nMetrics\nWe need to make sure we have a metric that works for multi-label classfication:\ndef accuracy_multi(inp, targ, thresh=0.5, sigmoid=True):\n    \"Compute accuracy when `inp` and `targ` are the same size.\"\n    if sigmoid: inp = inp.sigmoid()\n    return ((inp&gt;thresh)==targ.bool()).float().mean()\nWe can use partial to set the parameters we want in the metrics function and pass it like this:\nlearn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet50, metrics=partial(accuracy_multi, thresh=0.2))\nlearn.fine_tune(3, base_lr=3e-3, freeze_epochs=4)\nYou can change your metrics anytime and recalculate things. validate() will return the validation loss and metrics.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; learn.metrics = partial(accuracy_multi, thresh=0.1)\n&gt;&gt;&gt; learn.validate() # returns validation loss and metrics\n(#2) [0.10417556017637253,0.9376891851425171]\nYou can debug metrics by getting the predictions on the validation set with get_preds:\npreds,targs = learn.get_preds()\nassert preds.shape[0] == dls.valid.n\nOnce you have the predictions, you can run the metric function seperately:\naccuracy_multi(preds, targs, thresh=0.9, sigmoid=False)\n\n\nChoosing A Prediction Threshold\nxs = torch.linspace(0.05,0.95,29)\naccs = [accuracy_multi(preds, targs, thresh=i, sigmoid=False) for i in xs]\nplt.plot(xs,accs);\n\nIn this case, we’re using the validation set to pick a hyperparameter (the threshold), which is the purpose of the validation set. Sometimes students have expressed their concern that we might be overfitting to the validation set, since we’re trying lots of values to see which is the best. However, as you see in the plot, changing the threshold in this case results in a smooth curve, so we’re clearly not picking some inappropriate outlier. This is a good example of where you have to be careful of the difference between theory (don’t try lots of hyperparameter values or you might overfit the validation set) versus practice (if the relationship is smooth, then it’s fine to do this).",

Each folder in the dataset contains the images for one person. Therefore, we can create a splitter function that returns true for just one person, resulting in a validation set containing just that person’s images.\n\nPoints and Data Augmentation: We’re not aware of other libraries (except for fastai) that automatically and correctly apply data augmentation to coordinates. So, if you’re working with another library, you may need to disable data augmentation for these kinds of problems.\n\nThe only other difference from the previous data block examples is that the second block is a PointBlock. This is necessary so that fastai knows that the labels represent coordinates; that way, it knows that when doing data augmentation, it should do the same augmentation to these coordinates as it does to the images\n\n\nDebug the DataBlock\nUsing showbatch:\ndls = biwi.dataloaders(path)\ndls.show_batch(max_n=9, figsize=(8,6))\nInspect the shape:\nxb,yb = dls.one_batch()\nxb.shape,yb.shape\n\n\nTrain The Model\nAs usual, we can use cnn_learner to create our Learner. Remember way back in &lt;&gt; how we used y_range to tell fastai the range of our targets? We’ll do the same here - coordinates in fastai and PyTorch are always rescaled between -1 and +1 by the PointBlock, which is why you pass (-1, 1) to y_range.\n\nSetting y_range\n# Always use y_range when predicting a continous target\nlearn = cnn_learner(dls, resnet18, y_range=(-1,1))\nWe didn’t specify a loss function, which means we’re getting whatever fastai chooses as the default.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; dls.loss_func\nFlattenedLoss of MSELoss()\nNote also that we didn’t specify any metrics. That’s because the MSE is already a useful metric for this task (although it’s probably more interpretable after we take the square root).\n\nYou should always set y_range when predicting continuous targets. y_range is implemented in fastai using sigmoid_range, which is defined as:\ndef sigmoid_range(x, lo, hi): return torch.sigmoid(x) * (hi-lo) + lo\nThis is set as the final layer of the model, if y_range is defined. Take a moment to think about what this function does, and why it forces the model to output activations in the range (lo,hi).\nHere’s what it looks like:\nplot_function(partial(sigmoid_range,lo=-1,hi=1), min=-4, max=4)\n\n\n\n\nFind the learning rate and then train\nlearn.lr_find()\nlr = 1e-2\nlearn.fine_tune(3, lr)\n\n\nInspect the Results\nlearn.show_results(ds_idx=1, nrows=3, figsize=(6,8))",

This is different than .bashrc.\n\ncommonly loads the ~/.bashrc file as well.\nbin is traditionally the folder for binaries.\nbash_profile is designed to run when you login, so if you change it will not refresh until you login next time.\n\n\n\n.bashrc\n\n.bashrc it is executed simply before the command shell comes up, does not have to wait until you login.\netc/bashrc are system bashrc files which is like a “template” for user bashrc files. Anytime a new user is created, it inherits from this template and sometimes automated customizations are applied. This is usually done by simply importing etc/bashrc from each user’s bashrc file.\nenv will list all env variables.\nto apply .bashrc you just have to run the command bash as it will start another shell from your current one. However, if you run bash you can now exit without closing the shell, because a shell is running inside another shell.\n\n\n\n.bash_history\n\n~/.bash_history contains lots of history. By default will only capture last 100 but you can change this setting.\n\nyou can exlude something from saving to history (like passwords) by using an ignorespace\nthe environment variable HIST_CONTROL can be used to control how much history to keep and settings about what should not be logged. One way to turn off loggin is: bash     export HISTCONTROL=$HISTCONTROL:ignorespace this allow you to skip logging by adding a space to the the beginning of any command. If you want to see what is in HIST_CONTROL you will see:\n&gt; cat ~/.bash_history | grep HISTCONTROL\nHISTCONTROL=ignoredups:ignorespace\nignoredups was already set to this variable.\n\n\n\n.bash_logout\n\nDoesn’t always exist on a system. in most cases the contents of the ~/.bash_logout will be empty or contain a comment.\nThe role of this file is to execute things when you exit the shell. If you close the shell it will not work, you have to do a clean exit instead.\nCommon use is to use this to clear out ~/.bashrc with the original to clear out any changes the user may have made. You can accomplish this by copying a backup:\ncp ~/.bashrc.original ~/.bashrc",

    "text": "Shell Scripts\nPut your shell scripts in a folder you can find them. We can put them in ~/bin:\n&gt; mkdir bin\nMake sure in ~/.bash_profile you have:\nPATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin\nexport PATH\n\nchmod u+x\n\nTo make test.sh executable run command chmod u+x test.sh\n\nYou can also run chmod 755\n\n\nUsing Variables on The Command Line\n\ncan use any name that is not an environment variable (check with env).\nby convention variable names in ALLCAPS. bash     &gt; FIRSTNAME=\"Hamel\"\n  - No space b/w = and value.\n  - Good idea to __always__ put value in double quotes `\"`, although this is not required in every case.  \nAs a practice you want to use export command to set is as an environment variable. This makes the variable available to any subprocess that starts from the shell. Read more about this here.\n&gt; export FIRSTNAME\n&gt; echo \"Hello, $FIRSTNAME\"\n\"Hello Hamel\"\n\n&gt; export FIRSTNAME=\"Hamel\" # do this in one step\nThe above example could work without export, too just reinforcing that its a good idea to use this as a habit. You can do this in one step:\n\n\nUsing Substitution with backticks\n&gt; export TODAYSDATE=`date`  # executes date command\n\n\n\nUsing Variables in Scripts\n```bash\nMYUSERNAME='hamel'\nMYPASSWORD='password'\nSTARTOFSCRIPT=`date`\n\necho \"My login name for this app is $MYUSERNAME\"\necho \"My login password for this app is $MYPASSWORD\"\necho \"I started this script at $STARTOFSCRIPT\"\n\nENDOFSCRIPT=`date`\n\necho \"I ended the script at $ENDOFSCRIPT\"\n```\n\nThese variables only live within the sub-shell that executes the script.\n\n\n\nCommand Subsitution\n\nMethod 1 (Static): Assign command result to variable. Only runs the command at time of variable assignment.\n\n    TODAYSDATE=`date`\n    USERFILES=`find /home -user user` # find all directories owned by the user \"user\"\n\n    echo \"Today's Date: $TODAYSDATE\"\n    echo \"All files owned by USER: $USERFILES\"\n\nMethod 2: Use an alias, which allows you to run a command every time you call the alias. For aliases to work this way you must use the shopt command, which allows aliases to be useable in shell scripts. Technically referred to as “expanding aliases within a subshell”.\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    shopt -s expand_aliases\n\n    # notice that we don't use backticks here because the command we want to execute is put in \"..\"\n    alias TODAY=\"date\" \n    alias UFILES=\"find /home -user user\"\n\n\n    A=`TODAY` #Executes the command date\n    B=`UFILES`#Executes the command \n    echo \"With Alias, TODAY is: $A\" echo \"With Alias, UFILES is: $B\"\n\n\nExit Status\n\nValue = 0 means everything is ok\nValue != 0 means something is wrong.\nSee last exit status w/ the $? command:\n\n    &gt; ls\n    &gt; echo $?\n    0\n\nUsing exit statues in a shell script\n\nUnlike python, shell scripts will continue executing even if there is an error. You can prevent this by using set -e\n\n    set -e # means exit the shell if there is an error, don't continue.\n\n\n\nArithmetic Operations\n    expr 1 + 2\n    expr 2 \\* 2 # you have to escape the *\n    expr \\( 2 + 2 \\) \\* 4  # you must also escape the ( )\n\nCaveat: You need a space on each side of the operator.",

    "section": "Managing Processes (ps, kill, pkill)",
    "text": "Managing Processes (ps, kill, pkill)\n\nKill Single Process (ps, kill)\nA common scenario is that you might run a python script to train a model:\n$ python train.py\nLet’s say you want to kill this script for whatever reason. You might not always be able to type Cntrl + C to stop it, especially if this process is running in the background. (Aside: A way make a program run in the background is with a & for example:$ python train.py & )\nIn order to find this running program, you can use the command ps\n$ ps Gives you basic information (good enough most of the time)\nFlags:\n\n-e Allows you to see all running processes including from other users\n-f Allows you to see additional information about each process\n\nIn order to kill the process you will want to identify it’s PID for example, if the PID is 501 you can kill this process with the command:\n$ kill 501\n\n\nKilling Multiple Processes (pkill)\nIf you use process-based threading in python with a library like multi-processing, python will instantiate many processes for you. This is common thing to do in python for a task like data processing.\nLet’s consider the below example. When you run this in the background it will produce 8 processes:\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\nfrom time import sleep\n\ndef f(x):\n    sleep(1000) # simulate some computation\n    return x*x\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    with Pool(8) as p:\n        print(p.map(f, range(8)))\n\n$ python train_multi.py &\n\nAfter a few seconds, calling the command ps will yield something like this:\nPID TTY           TIME CMD\n 3982 ttys002    0:00.09 ...MacOS/Python train_multi.py\n 4219 ttys002    0:00.00 ...MacOS/Python train_multi.py\n 4220 ttys002    0:00.00 ...MacOS/Python train_multi.py\n 4221 ttys002    0:00.00 ...MacOS/Python train_multi.py\n 4222 ttys002    0:00.00 ...MacOS/Python train_multi.py\n 4223 ttys002    0:00.00 ...MacOS/Python train_multi.py\n 4224 ttys002    0:00.00 ...MacOS/Python train_multi.py\n 4225 ttys002    0:00.00 ...MacOS/Python train_multi.py\n 4226 ttys002    0:00.00 ...MacOS/Python train_multi.py\nYou can find all processes with the file train_multi.py with the pkill command and the -f flag:\n\n\n\nSee Parent / Child Processes (pstree)\npstree is also a helpful utility to see parent/child relationships between processes. You can install pstree on a mac with brew install pstree\nIn the above example, there are 8 sub-processes created by one python process. Running the command\n$ pstree -s train_multi.py\nWill show the process hierarchy. The -s flag allows you to filter parents and descendants of processes containing a string in their command. In the below example, PID 41592 will kill all the 8 child processes seen below\n\n\n\nKilling Process Options\n\nReminder: view processes with ps or top To show processes from all users ps aux\n\nTo restart pid 6996 kill -1 6996\nkill pid 6996 kill -9 6996\n\nYou can kill processes by name (which is also usually listed as the command that started the processes). killall will search for the string int he relevant process.\n\n\nBringing processes back into the foreground\nReminder you put processes in the background with & example is myscript.sh &\nYou can move processes back into the foreground with fg\nfg 1234 brings process 1234 back into the foreground.",

    "text": "Bundling & Archiving Files (tar)\nYou commonly want to package a bunch of files together, such as a collection of photos or CSVs, and optionally compress these with its directory structure intact. A common tool for this is tar . This is how you would bundle and compress a directory of CSV files:\n\n\nSending An Archive To A Remote Machine\nIt is often the case you want to send data to a remote machine. The below command creates a directory called data , compresses all files in a local folder named csv_data , with the exception of the sub-directory csv_data/intermediate_files without creating any temporary files locally:\nOptionally, create the directory on the remote machine:\n\nThen, stream the archive directly to remote. Note that providing a — instead of a destination filename allows tar to write to a stream (stdout) that can be sent directly to the remote server.\n\n\n\nMoving Files In Different Directories Into An Archive\nIf your files exist in sibling directories, rather than under one parent directory you can use find along with tar . Suppose you want to archive all csv files relative to a directory:\n\nWhen you archive files on the fly above with find you cannot compress the files until the archive is finished being built, therefore you have to compress the tar file with the gzip command:\n\n$ gzip data.tar\n\nTip: some people like to use locate with updatedb instead of find. There are tradeoffs so make sure you read the documentation carefully!\n\n\nUnpacking & Decompressing Archives\nYou can decompress and unpack a tar file, for example data.tar.gz with the following command:\n\n$ tar -xzvf data.tar.gz\n\nIf the data is not compressed, you can leave out the -z flag:\n\n$ tar -xvf data.tar",

    "section": "File Permissions",
    "text": "File Permissions\nBefore we begin, we must introduce some nomenclature:\n\nIf you run the command ls -a you will see something similar to the below output for all of your files in the current directory.\n\nThe file permissions are shown in three-character groupings for three different groups (nine characters total). These three groups are the owner , group , and other users. In this case, the owner name is hamel and the group name is staff\nFor the owner, the file permissions are rwx which means that the owner has read r , write w , and execute x permissions.\nFor the group, the file permissions are r-x which means the group has read and execute permissions, but not write permissions. A group is a collection of users with common permissions.\nFinally, all other users have file permissions of r– which means only read permissions.\n\nChanging File Permissions\nThere are several ways to change file permissions.\nMethod 1: Using Characters and +, -\nRefer to the nomenclature above to follow along\n\nchmod o-r csvfiles.tar.gz\nRemoves - the ability of other users o to read r the file.\nchmod g+w csvfiles.tar.gz\nAdds + the ability of the group g to write w to the file.\nchmod u+x csvfiles.tar.gz\nAdds + the ability of the owner u to execute x the file.\nchomd a+x csvfiles.tar.gz\nAdds + the ability of all users a to execute x the file.\n\nMethod 2: using numbers\nThis method works by adding up the numbers corresponding to the permissions separately for each user group (owner, group, others). For example:\n\nchmod 777 csvfiles.tar.gz\nThis gives all users the ability to read (4), write( 2), and execute (1) files. In other words 4+2+1 = 7, for the owner, group and other users.\nchmod 732 csvfiles.tar.gz\nThis gives the owner the ability to read, write and execute ( 4+2+1=7), the group the ability to write and execute (2+1=3) and all other users only the ability to write (2).\n\n\n\nChanging Ownership\nYou can change the owner or group assigned to a file like this:\nchown newuser:newgroup file\nThe :newgroup is optional, if you do not specify that the group will stay the same.",
