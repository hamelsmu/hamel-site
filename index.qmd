I am a machine learning engineer with over 20 years of experience. I have worked at companies such as Airbnb and GitHub, which included early LLM <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09436"> research </a>used by OpenAI for <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-text-and-code-embeddings">code understanding</a>. I have also led and contributed to numerous popular [open-source](oss/opensource.qmd) machine-learning tools. I am currently an independent consultant [helping](https://parlance-labs.com/) companies build AI products.

## 💼 Work With Me

I co-teach a popular course, **[AI Evals for Engineers & PMs](https://maven.com/parlance-labs/evals)**.  We have taught over 3,000 students from 500+ companies including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.  I encourage you to check it out if you are interested in systematically improving your AI products.

If you need more hands-on help, I'm open to new consulting work and other forms of advisory. If you need help with your project, you can find [more information here](https://parlance-labs.com/).
