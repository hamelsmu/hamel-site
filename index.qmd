I am a machine learning engineer with over 20 years of [experience](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hamelhusain/). I have worked with innovative companies such as Airbnb and GitHub, which included <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-text-and-code-embeddings#:~:text=models%20on%20the-,CodeSearchNet,),-evaluation%20suite%20where">early LLM research used by OpenAI</a>, for code understanding. I have also led and contributed to numerous popular [open-source](oss/opensource.qmd) machine-learning tools. I am currently an independent consultant helping companies operationalize Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate their AI product journey.
