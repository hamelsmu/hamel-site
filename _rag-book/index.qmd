# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book compiles talks on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) from our [AI Evals course](https://bit.ly/evals-ai){target="_blank"}. The speakers are researchers and practitioners who build production retrieval systems.

## About This Book

Each chapter is an annotated presentation with timestamped references to the original videos. You can skim the annotations or dive into the full talks.

The field has moved beyond the "embed documents and search" approach that dominated 2023. The topics covered here represent where retrieval is heading: better evaluation methods, reasoning-enhanced search, late interaction models, multiple representations, context engineering, and infrastructure decisions.
