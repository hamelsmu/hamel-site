# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book is a compilation of advanced talks on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that were part of our [AI Evals course](https://bit.ly/evals-ai){target="_blank"}. The series features leading researchers and practitioners who share cutting-edge techniques for building production-ready RAG systems.

## About This Book

This handbook condenses **over 6 hours of expert instruction** into annotated presentations that allow you to quickly learn advanced RAG techniques in under an hour. Each chapter is based on detailed presentations from world-class researchers who are pushing the boundaries of what's possible with retrieval systems.

The field of RAG is rapidly evolving beyond the simple "embed documents and search" paradigm that dominated 2023. This book presents six key areas where the field is advancing:

1. **Why RAG Isn't Dead** - Understanding the evolution beyond naive single-vector search
2. **Modern Evaluation** - New benchmarks and metrics for the RAG era  
3. **Reasoning-Enhanced Retrieval** - Incorporating instruction-following and reasoning into search
4. **Late Interaction Models** - Moving beyond single vectors to token-level representations
5. **Multiple Representations** - Building flexible systems with diverse data maps
6. **Context Rot** - Understanding how LLM performance degrades with longer contexts

Each chapter combines theory with implementation guidance, code examples, and real-world applications. The presentations are annotated with timestamped references to the original videos, allowing you to dive deeper into specific topics that interest you most.
