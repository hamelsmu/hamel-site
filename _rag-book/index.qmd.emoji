# Introduction

This book is a compilation of a 5-part mini-series on evaluating and optimizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The series was originally presented as part of an LLM Evals course and features insights from leading researchers in the field.

## Overview

The series covers:

1. **Part 1**: Ben Clavié's introduction to advanced retrieval techniques beyond basic RAG
2. **Part 2**: Nandan Thakur on why traditional IR evals are insufficient for RAG
3. **Part 3**: Orion Weller on optimizing retrieval with reasoning models
4. **Part 4**: Antoine Chaffin on late interaction models for RAG
5. **Part 5**: Bryan Bischof and Ayush Chaurasia on RAG with multiple representations

Each chapter contains annotated presentations with timestamped links to the original video content.
