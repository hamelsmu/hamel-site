# Conclusion {.unnumbered}

RAG has moved past the simple "embed and search" approach from 2023. The presentations in this book show what that looks like in practice: richer representations, instruction-following retrievers, careful evaluation, and thoughtful infrastructure choices.

## Looking Forward

Rather than compressing all information into a single vector, we're seeing systems that maintain multi-faceted representations, reason about relevance, and combine classical techniques with modern ones.

The tooling is maturing. Libraries like PyLate, frameworks like RAGatouille, and vector databases with advanced retrieval support make these techniques accessible.
