# FAQ SEO Optimization Plan

## Overview
This plan details how to break up the FAQ post at `blog/posts/evals-faq/index.qmd` into individual posts for SEO purposes while maintaining the combined post for readability. The individual posts will be excluded from the main blog listing.

## Current Structure Analysis
The FAQ post contains approximately 27 individual Q&A sections, each starting with `## Q:` followed by the question. The structure is:
- YAML frontmatter with metadata
- Introduction and course promotion
- Multiple Q&A sections
- Course promotion at the end
- References/footnotes

## Strategy

### 1. Create Individual FAQ Posts
**Location**: Create individual posts in the same directory `blog/posts/evals-faq/` to preserve image paths.

**Naming Convention**: Use kebab-case based on the question:
- `blog/posts/evals-faq/what-are-llm-evals.qmd`
- `blog/posts/evals-faq/is-rag-dead.qmd` 
- `blog/posts/evals-faq/same-model-for-task-and-evaluation.qmd`
- etc.

**Individual Post Structure**:
```yaml
---
title: "Q: [Original Question Title]"
description: "[Brief description of the answer]"
categories: [LLMs, evals, faq]
author: 
  - Hamel Husain
  - Shreya Shankar
date: [same as original post]
image: images/eval_faq.png
exclude-from-listing: true  # This will exclude from main blog listing
aliases:
  - /evals-faq/[slug]  # Create short aliases for each FAQ
---
```

### 2. Exclude Individual Posts from Main Listing
**Method**: Use the `exclude-from-listing: true` metadata field in each individual FAQ post's frontmatter.

**Update main listing**: Modify `index.qmd` to exclude these posts by adding to the listing configuration:
```yaml
listing:
  # ... existing config ...
  exclude:
    exclude-from-listing: true
```

### 3. Rebuild Combined Post Using Includes
**Update `blog/posts/evals-faq/index.qmd`**:
- Keep the original frontmatter and introduction
- Replace each Q&A section with an include statement
- Keep the course promotions and references

**New structure**:
```markdown
---
[original frontmatter]
---

[Introduction content]

{{< include what-are-llm-evals.qmd >}}

{{< include is-rag-dead.qmd >}}

{{< include same-model-for-task-and-evaluation.qmd >}}

[... continue for all FAQs ...]

[Course promotion and references]
```

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Extract Questions and Create Individual Files
1. **Parse the FAQ post** programmatically to identify each Q&A section
2. **Extract sections** that start with `## Q:` and continue until the next `## Q:` or end of content
3. **Create individual .qmd files** for each question in the same directory

### Phase 2: Create Individual Post Files
For each extracted Q&A:
1. **Generate appropriate title** from the question
2. **Create slug/filename** using kebab-case
3. **Add proper frontmatter** with metadata
4. **Include the full Q&A content** without the `## Q:` header (since it's now in the title)
5. **Add navigation links** to related FAQs if desired

### Phase 3: Update Main Listing Configuration
1. **Modify `index.qmd`** to exclude posts with `exclude-from-listing: true`
2. **Test the listing** to ensure individual FAQ posts don't appear

### Phase 4: Rebuild Combined Post
1. **Update `blog/posts/evals-faq/index.qmd`** to use includes
2. **Replace each Q&A section** with `{{< include filename.qmd >}}`
3. **Test rendering** to ensure the combined post looks identical to the original

## Programmatic Extraction Script Requirements

The script should:
1. **Read the original FAQ file**
2. **Parse sections** that start with `## Q:` 
3. **Extract content** until the next section or end
4. **Generate appropriate filenames** from questions
5. **Create individual .qmd files** with proper frontmatter
6. **Generate the include statements** for the main file
7. **Handle edge cases** like images, links, and special formatting

## Testing

After implementation:
1. **Run `quarto render`** to build the site
2. **Check `_site` folder** to verify:
   - Individual FAQ posts exist and render correctly
   - Individual FAQ posts don't appear in main blog listing
   - Combined FAQ post renders identically to original
   - All images and links work correctly
   - SEO metadata is properly set for individual posts

## SEO Benefits

This approach provides:
- **Individual URLs** for each FAQ for targeted SEO
- **Focused meta descriptions** for each question
- **Preserved user experience** with the combined readable post
- **Clean URL structure** with meaningful slugs
- **Maintained link structure** (images, internal links work)

## File Structure After Implementation

```
blog/posts/evals-faq/
├── index.qmd                           # Combined post using includes
├── images/                             # Existing images (unchanged)
├── what-are-llm-evals.qmd            # Individual FAQ posts

├── how-much-time-model-selection.qmd
├── custom-annotation-tool.qmd

```

This structure maintains the existing user experience while optimizing for search engines through individual, focused pages for each FAQ.
