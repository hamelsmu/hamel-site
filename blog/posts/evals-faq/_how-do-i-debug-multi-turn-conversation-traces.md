## Q: How do I debug multi-turn conversation traces?

Start simple. Check if the whole conversation met the user's goal with a pass/fail judgment. Look at the entire trace and focus on the first upstream failure. Read the user-visible parts first to understand if something went wrong. Only then dig into the technical details like tool calls and intermediate steps.

When you find a failure, reproduce it with the simplest possible test case. Here's an example: suppose a shopping bot gives the wrong return policy on turn 4 of a conversation. Before diving into the full multi-turn complexity, simplify it to a single turn: "What is the return window for product X1000?" If it still fails, you've proven the error isn't about conversation context - it's likely a basic retrieval or knowledge issue you can debug more easily.

For generating test cases, you have two main approaches. First, you can simulate users with another LLM to create realistic multi-turn conversations. Second, use "N-1 testing" where you provide the first N-1 turns of a real conversation and test what happens next. The N-1 approach often works better since it uses actual conversation prefixes rather than fully synthetic interactions (but is less flexible and doesn't test the full conversation). User simulation is getting better as models improve.  Keep an eye on this space.

The key is balancing thoroughness with efficiency. Not every multi-turn failure requires multi-turn analysis. [â†—](#q-how-do-i-debug-multi-turn-conversation-traces){.faq-individual-link}
