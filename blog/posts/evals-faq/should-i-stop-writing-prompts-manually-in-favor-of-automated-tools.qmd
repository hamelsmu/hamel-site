Automating prompt engineering can be tempting, but you should be skeptical of tools that promise to optimize prompts for you, especially in  early stages of development. When you write a prompt, you are forced to clarify your assumptions and externalize your requirements. Good writing is good thinking [^2].  If you delegate this task to an automated tool too early, you risk never fully understanding your own requirements or the model's failure modes.

This is because automated prompt optimization typically hill-climb a predefined evaluation metric. It can refine a prompt to perform better on known failures, but it cannot discover *new* ones. Discovering new errors requires [error analysis](/blog/posts/evals-faq/why-is-error-analysis-so-important-in-llm-evals-and-how-is-it-performed.html){target="_blank"}. Furthermore, research shows that evaluation criteria tends to shift after reviewing a model's outputs, a phenomenon known as “criteria drift” [^3]. This means that evaluation is an iterative, human-driven sensemaking process, not a static target that can be set once and handed off to an optimizer.

A pragmatic approach is to use LLMs to improve your prompt based on [open coding](/blog/posts/evals-faq/why-is-error-analysis-so-important-in-llm-evals-and-how-is-it-performed.html){target="_blank"} (open-ended notes about traces). This way, you maintain a human in the loop who is looking at the data and externalizing their requirements. Once you have a high-quality set of evals, prompt optimization can be effective for that last mile of performance.
