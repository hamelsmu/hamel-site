## Q: What's your favorite eval vendor?

Eval tools are in an intensely competitive space.  It would be futile to compare their features.  If I tried to do such an analysis, it would be invalidated in a week!  Vendors I encounter the most organically in my work are: [Langsmith](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith){target="_blank"}, [Arize](https://arize.com/){target="_blank"} and [Braintrust](https://www.braintrust.dev/){target="_blank"}.

When I help clients with vendor selection, the decision weighs heavily towards who can offer the best support, as opposed to purely features.  This changes depending on size of client, use case, etc. Yes - it's mainly the human factor that matters, and dare I say, vibes.

I have no favorite vendor.  At the core, their features are very similar - and I often build [custom tools](https://hamel.dev/blog/posts/evals/#q-should-i-build-a-custom-annotation-tool-or-use-something-off-the-shelf){target="_blank"} on top of them to fit my needs. 

Here is a [video series](/blog/posts/eval-tools/) that has a live commentary on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the three aforementioned vendors.
