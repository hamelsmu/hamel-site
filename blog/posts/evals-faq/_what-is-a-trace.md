## Q: What is a trace?

A trace is the complete record of all actions, messages, tool calls, and data retrievals from a single initial user query through to the final response. It includes every step across all agents, tools, and system components in a session: multiple user messages, assistant responses, retrieved documents, and intermediate tool interactions.

**Why not individual request-response pairs?** Many errors only make sense in full context. Breaking traces into single turns creates far more data to review and misses the bigger picture needed for effective [error analysis](#q-why-is-error-analysis-so-important-in-llm-evals-and-how-is-it-performed). Errors cascade: early mistakes cause multiple downstream failures. Full-trace annotation helps spot these chains and avoids labeling each dependent error separately.

**Note on terminology:** Different observability vendors use varying definitions of traces and spans. [Alex Strick van Linschoten's analysis](https://mlops.systems/posts/2025-06-04-instrumenting-an-agentic-app-with-arize-phoenix-and-litellm.html) explains these vendor differences, but the core concept of capturing complete user journeys remains consistent.
