## Q: What is a trace?

A trace is the complete record of all actions, messages, tool calls, and data retrievals from a single initial user query through to the final response. It includes every step across all agents, tools, and system components in a session: multiple user messages, assistant responses, retrieved documents, and intermediate tool interactions.

**Note on terminology:** Different observability vendors use varying definitions of traces and spans.
