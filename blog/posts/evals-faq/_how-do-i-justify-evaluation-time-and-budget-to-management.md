## Q: How do I justify evaluation time and budget to management?

**Keep a log of every error you catch.** Document learnings found during [error analysis](#q-why-is-error-analysis-so-important-in-llm-evals-and-how-is-it-performed), the fix implemented, and the potential impact avoided. Present this log weekly or monthly to management: "Here are 47 issues we caught before users saw them, plus insights about users, the system, and the product." Start small and prove value incrementally by sharing specific data and learnings.

**Frame evaluation as core development, not optional testing.** You wouldn't ship software without unit tests. Evaluation serves the same function for LLM applications.
