## Q: How do I choose the right chunk size for my document processing tasks? [ðŸ”—](/blog/posts/evals-faq/how-do-i-choose-the-right-chunk-size-for-my-document-processing-tasks.html){.faq-link-icon}

Unlike RAG, where chunks are optimized for retrieval, document processing assumes the model will see every chunk. The goal is to split text so the model can reason effectively without being overwhelmed. Even if a document fits within the context window, it might be better to break it up. Long inputs can degrade performance due to attention bottlenecks, especially in the middle of the context. Two task types require different strategies:

### 1. Fixed-Output Tasks â†’ Large Chunks

These are tasks where the output length doesn't grow with input: extracting a number, answering a specific question, classifying a section. For example:

* "What's the penalty clause in this contract?"
* "What was the CEO's salary in 2023?"

Use the largest chunk (with caveats) that likely contains the answer. This reduces the number of queries and avoids context fragmentation. However, avoid adding irrelevant text. Models are sensitive to distraction, especially with large inputs. The middle parts of a long input might be under-attended. Furthermore, if cost and latency are a bottleneck, you should consider preprocessing or filtering the document (via keyword search or a lightweight retriever) to isolate relevant sections before feeding a huge chunk.

### 2. Expansive-Output Tasks â†’ Smaller Chunks

These include summarization, exhaustive extraction, or any task where output grows with input. For example:

* "Summarize each section"
* "List all customer complaints"

In these cases, smaller chunks help preserve reasoning quality and output completeness. The standard approach is to process each chunk independently, then aggregate results (e.g., map-reduce). When sizing your chunks, try to respect content boundaries like paragraphs, sections, or chapters. Chunking also helps mitigate output limits. By breaking the task into pieces, each piece's output can stay within limits.

### General Guidance

It's important to recognize **why chunk size affects results**. A larger chunk means the model has to reason over more information in one go â€“ essentially, a heavier cognitive load. LLMs have limited capacity to **retain and correlate details across a long text**. If too much is packed in, the model might prioritize certain parts (commonly the beginning or end) and overlook or "forget" details in the middle. This can lead to overly coarse summaries or missed facts. In contrast, a smaller chunk bounds the problem: the model can pay full attention to that section. You are trading off **global context for local focus**. 

No rule of thumb can perfectly determine the best chunk size for your use case â€“ **you should validate with experiments**. The optimal chunk size can vary by domain and model. I treat chunk size as a hyperparameter to tune.
