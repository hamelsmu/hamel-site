![With Dokku, you can turn a VPS into a powerful serverless platform](images/serverless.png)

## What is Dokku?

[Dokku](https://dokku.com/) is an open-source Platform as a Service (PaaS) that runs on a single server of your choice. **It's like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), but you own it.** It is a great way to get the benefits of Heroku without the costs (Heroku can get quite expensive!). I need to deploy many applications for my [LLM consulting work](https://parlance-labs.com/).  Having a cost-effective, easy-to-use serverless platform is essential for me.

**I run a Dokku server on a $7/month VPS on [OVHcloud](https://us.ovhcloud.com/)** for non-gpu workloads.  These applications include things like [nbsanity](https://nbsanity.com/) and [data cleaning tools for LLMs](https://langfree.parlance-labs.com/tutorials/shiny.html#run-the-shiny-app-locally). 

Some of the features I love about Dokku:

- Easy to use (like Heroku).
- Automatic SSL certificate management via [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
- Basic Auth support so I can password-protect sites.
- Scale up and down with a single command.
- Flexibility to handle any application (Node, Python, etc), including defining a Docker container.
- Lots of [official plugins](https://dokku.com/docs/community/plugins/?h=plugins#official-plugins) that do almost anything I want.
- Easily deploy with git commands.

# Minimal Dokku Examples

Make sure you [install Dokku](https://dokku.com/docs/getting-started/installation/) on your VPS.  As I mentioned, I use [OVH](https://us.ovhcloud.com/).

## Deploying Apps as A Docker Container

An easy way to deploy applications is with a Docker container.

To deploy a Docker container, I put a Dockerfile in the root of my git repo like this:

```{.dockerfile filename="Dockerfile"}
FROM python:3.10

COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app

# Install the local package
RUN pip install .

# This directory contains app.py, a FastApi app
WORKDIR /app/

ENTRYPOINT ["./entrypoint.sh"]
```

:::{.callout-tip}

The `entrypoint.sh` script allows me to easily run the app locally or in a Docker container.  It looks like this:

```{.bash filename="entrypoint.sh"}
#!/bin/bash
exec uvicorn main:app --port "$PORT" --host 0.0.0.0
```

::::

On the Dokku host, create the app:

```bash
dokku apps:create myapp
```

**Locally**, set up access to the Dokku host and name it `dokku` in your `~/.ssh/config` file.  For example, here is mine:

```
Host dokku
  HostName <The external IP address of your Dokku host>
  User ubuntu
  IdentityFile /Users/hamel/.ssh/dokku
```

Locally, add the Dokku host as a remote and push to it:

```bash
git remote add dokku dokku@dokku:myapp
git push dokku main
```

That's it - your app should be running on the Dokku host!  Your local logs will print the URL that your application is served on, which by default will be `myapp.yourdomain.com`. You can also scale it up/down with the following command:

```bash
#scale to two workers
dokku ps:scale myapp web=2
```

We are just scratching the surface.  For more details, see the [Dokku docs](https://dokku.com/docs/).

## Static Sites

GitHub Pages is annoying in that you can't easily deploy private static sites without paying for an expensive Enterprise account.  With Dokku, you can easily deploy a static site from a private GitHub Repo and password-protect it.

We will assume that you have a static site in a git repo in a folder named `_site`.

**On the Dokku host**, create an app named `mysite` and set the `NGINX_ROOT` environment variable to `_site`:

```bash
dokku apps:create mystite
dokku config:set static-site NGINX_ROOT=_site
```

Also on the Dokku host, install [basic auth](https://github.com/dokku/dokku-http-auth) and [set permissions](https://github.com/dokku/dokku-http-auth/issues/15#issuecomment-1637058437) so the plugin can work properly.

```bash
# do setup for the auth plugin that we will use later
sudo dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-http-auth.git
sudo chmod +x /home/dokku
```

Then execute the following commands from the root of your git repo that contains the static site. :

```bash
touch .static # <1> 
echo BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/dokku/buildpack-nginx > .env # <2>
git remote add dokku dokku@dokku:mysite # <3>
```
1. tells `dokku` that this is a static site
2. tells `dokku` to use the nginx buildpack for static sites (it will usually automatically detect this, but if you have a project with code and a static site, you need to tell it to use the nginx buildpack so it doesn't get confused).
3. add the `dokku` host as a remote.  For this to work, make sure `dokku` is a hostname in your `~/.ssh/config` file as described [in the previous section](#deploying-apps-as-a-docker-container).

Finally, deploy your application:

```bash
git push dokku main
```

You can now add auth by running the following command on the Dokku host:

```bash 
dokku http-auth:enable mystite <username> <password>
```

:::{.callout-note}

You can add multiple usernames/passwords and even filter specific IPs.  See [the docs](https://github.com/dokku/dokku-http-auth).

### SSL / HTTPS

It's often desirable to have HTTPS for your site.  Dokku makes this easy with the [Let's Encrypt Plugin](https://github.com/dokku/dokku-letsencrypt), which will even auto-renew for you.  I don't use this, because I'm letting [Cloudflare handle this with its proxy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/). 

If you are using Cloudflare this way, activating this plugin will mess things up (don't worry its easy to disable).  Honestly, I think it's easier to let Cloudflare handle it if you are already doing so.

# Deploying With GitHub Actions

You can automatically deploy Dokku apps with GitHub Actions, which is helpful if you don't want to fiddle with pushing to the Dokku host.  Here is an example GitHub Action workflow that does this:

```{.yaml filename="deploy-dokku.yml"}
name: CI
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  push:
    branches: [main]

concurrency: # Cancel previous jobs to avoid deploy locks on dokku
  group: ${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  deploy-dokku:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      
      - name: Install SSH key
        run: |
          echo "${{ secrets.DOKKU_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}" > private_key.pem
          chmod 600 private_key.pem

      - name: Add remote and push
        run: |
          git remote add dokku dokku@rechat.co:llm-eval
          GIT_SSH_COMMAND="ssh -i private_key.pem -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" git push dokku main -f
```

# Miscellaneous Tips

These are things I often forget, so I'm writing them down here.  For these examples, assume my app is named `llm-eval` and my host is `rechat.co`.

## Run commands remotely

You don't have to ssh into the Dokku host just to execute commands. You can execute them remotely via the `dokku` user like this:

```bash
# https://dokku.com/docs/deployment/application-management/
ssh dokku@rechat.co apps:list
```

## Docker cache

This is how you can [invalidate the docker cache](https://dokku.com/docs/advanced-usage/repository-management/) for a fresh build:

```bash
ssh dokku@rechat.co repo:purge-cache llm-eval
```

## Rebuild without pushing

Sometimes you want to rebuild without pushing.  There are [many ways to do this](https://dokku.com/docs/processes/process-management/), but one way is like this:

```bash
ssh dokku@rehcat.co ps:rebuild llm-eval
```


# Why Did I Write This?

I had to dig up these details whenever I wanted to deploy a new app, so I had to write it up anyway.  I hope you find it useful, too!
