# I don't use RAG, I just retrieve documents

As part of our [LLM Evals course](https://bit.ly/evals-ai), I hosted [Benjamin Clavi√©](https://ben.clavie.eu/) to kick off a 5-part mini-series on evaluating and optimizing RAG. Ben is a retrieval researcher who has built widely used tools like [RAGatouille](https://github.com/answerdotai/ragatouille) and [rerankers](https://github.com/answerdotai/rerankers) among other things. His talk focused on important developments in RAG and where you should be paying attention (late-interaction, reasoning, evals, multimodal, etc.).

Below is an annotated version of the presentation, with timestamped links for each slide.

## Introduction

![](../p1-images/slide_1.png)

Ben starts by introducing himself and his background in retrieval research. He's the founder of [Answer.ai](https://answer.ai/), a company focused on building better retrieval systems.

## The State of RAG

![](../p1-images/slide_2.png)

Ben discusses the current state of RAG and how it's evolved over the past year. He notes that while RAG has become more popular, there's still a lot of confusion about what it is and how to use it effectively.

## RAG is Not Just About Context Windows

![](../p1-images/slide_3.png)

A common misconception is that RAG is just about extending context windows. Ben emphasizes that RAG is about finding the most relevant information for a given query, regardless of context window size.

## The Evolution of Retrieval

![](../p1-images/slide_4.png)

Ben traces the evolution of retrieval from simple keyword matching to modern neural approaches. He highlights how retrieval has become more sophisticated over time.

## Dense Retrieval

![](../p1-images/slide_5.png)

Dense retrieval involves encoding queries and documents into dense vector representations and finding the most similar documents to a query. This approach has become the standard for modern retrieval systems.

## Hybrid Retrieval

![](../p1-images/slide_6.png)

Hybrid retrieval combines multiple retrieval methods (e.g., dense and sparse) to get the best of both worlds. Ben discusses how hybrid approaches can improve retrieval quality.

## Re-ranking

![](../p1-images/slide_7.png)

Re-ranking involves taking the results from a retrieval system and re-ordering them based on a more sophisticated model. This can significantly improve retrieval quality.

## Late Interaction

![](../p1-images/slide_8.png)

Late interaction defers expensive operations until they're needed. Ben explains how this approach can make retrieval more efficient.

## Reasoning Over Documents

![](../p1-images/slide_9.png)

Reasoning over documents involves synthesizing information across multiple sources. Ben discusses how this can lead to more accurate and comprehensive answers.

## Evaluating RAG Systems

![](../p1-images/slide_10.png)

Ben emphasizes the importance of evaluating RAG systems properly. He discusses various metrics and approaches for measuring retrieval quality.

## The Future of RAG

![](../p1-images/slide_11.png)

Ben concludes by discussing the future of RAG and where he sees the field heading. He emphasizes that RAG will continue to evolve and improve as retrieval methods become more sophisticated.

## Q&A

The presentation ends with a Q&A session where Ben answers questions from the audience about RAG, retrieval, and related topics.
