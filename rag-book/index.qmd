# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

## The Future of AI is Retrieval

In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, one technology stands at the intersection of knowledge and generation: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Despite claims that larger context windows might render it obsolete, RAG continues to be the backbone of the most powerful AI systems today.

This book takes you on a journey through the world of RAG—from its fundamental concepts to cutting-edge techniques that are reshaping how AI systems access and utilize information. RAG isn't just about extending context windows; it's about finding the *right* information at the right time.

As large language models continue to advance, the ability to retrieve relevant information becomes not less important, but more critical. Even with infinite context, the challenge of finding the needle in the haystack remains. This is where RAG shines—providing AI systems with the ability to access and leverage external knowledge beyond their training data.

In the following chapters, we'll explore:

- Why RAG is far from dead, and in fact, just getting started
- Advanced retrieval techniques that go beyond simple vector similarity
- Evaluation methods to measure and improve RAG system performance
- Reasoning capabilities that allow models to synthesize information across sources
- Late interaction approaches that make retrieval more efficient and effective
- A comprehensive map of the RAG landscape to guide your implementation

Whether you're building your first RAG system or looking to optimize an existing one, this book provides the insights and techniques you need to harness the full power of Retrieval Augmented Generation.
